<p>Transcriber's Notes: Minor typos have been corrected. There is Persian and Russian writing in this
book, which have been marked as [Persian] or as [Russian]. In this text, full page illustrations used
the same page number as the previous non illustration page, so, for example, there were two page 16. I have
added an a after the illustration page number for the sake of clarity.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>I have to express my indebtedness first of all to the executors of
Henrietta MacOubrey, George Borrow's stepdaughter, who kindly placed
Borrow's letters and manuscripts at my disposal. To the survivor of
these executors, a lady who resides in an English provincial town, I
would particularly wish to render fullest acknowledgment did she not
desire to escape all publicity and forbid me to give her name in print.
I am indebted to Sir William Robertson Nicoll without whose kindly and
active intervention I should never have taken active steps to obtain the
material to which this biography owes its principal value. I am under
great obligations to Mr. Herbert Jenkins, the publisher, in that,
although the author of a successful biography of Borrow, he has, with
rare kindliness, brought me into communication with Mr. Wilfrid J.
Bowring, the grandson of Sir John Bowring. To Mr. Wilfrid Bowring I am
indebted in that he has handed to me the whole of Borrow's letters to
his grandfather. I have to thank Mr. James Hooper of Norwich for the
untiring zeal with which he has unearthed for me a valuable series of
notes including<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> certain interesting letters concerning Borrow. Mr.
Hooper has generously placed his collection, with which he at one time
contemplated writing a biography of Borrow, in my hands. I thank Dr.
Aldis Wright for reading my chapter on Edward FitzGerald; also Mr. W.H.
Peet, Mr. Aleck Abrahams, and Mr. Joseph Shaylor for assistance in the
little known field of Sir Richard Phillips's life. I have further to
thank my friends, Edward Clodd and Thomas J. Wise, for reading my
proof-sheets. To Theodore Watts-Dunton, an untiring friend of thirty
years, I have also to acknowledge abundant obligations.</p>

<p>C. K. S.</p>

Circle</i>. The title had then an element of novelty, Dante Gabriel
Rossetti's <i>Dante and his Circle</i>, at the time the only book of this
particular character, having quite another aim. There are now some
twenty or more biographies based upon a similar plan.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The method has
its convenience where there are earlier lives of a given writer, as one
can in this way differentiate the book from previous efforts by making
one's hero stand out among his friends. Some such apology, I feel, is
necessary, because, in these days of the multiplication of books, every
book, at least other than a work of imagination, requires ample apology.
In <i>Charlotte Bront&euml; and her Circle</i> I was able to claim that, even
though following in the footsteps of Mrs. Gaskell, I had added some four
hundred new letters by Charlotte Bront&euml; to the world's knowledge of that
interesting woman, and still more considerably enlarged our knowledge of
her sister Emily. This achievement has been generously acknowledged, and
I am most proud of the testimony of the most accomplished of living
biographers, Sir George Otto Trevelyan, who once rendered me the
following quite spontaneous tribute:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have lately read <i>aloud</i> for the second time your Bront&euml;
book; let alone private readings. It is unique in plan and
excellence, and I am greatly obliged to you for it. Apart from
the pleasure of the book, the form of it has always interested
me as a professional biographer. It certainly is novel; and in
this case I am pretty sure that it is right.</p></div>

<p>With such a testimony before me I cannot hesitate to present my second
biography in similar form. In the case of George Borrow, however, I am
not in a position to supplement one transcendent biography, as in the
case of Charlotte Bront&euml; and Mrs. Gaskell. I have before me no less than
four biographies of Borrow, every one of them of distinctive merit.
These are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Life, Writings, and Correspondence of George Borrow.</i> Derived
from Official and other Authentic Sources. By William I. Knapp,
Ph.D., LL.D. 2 vols. John Murray, 1899.</p>

<p><i>George Borrow: The Man and his Work.</i> By R. A. J. Walling.
Cassell, 1908.</p>

<p><i>The Life of George Borrow.</i> Compiled from Unpublished Official
Documents. His Works, Correspondence, etc. By Herbert Jenkins.
John Murray, 1912.</p>

<p><i>George Borrow: The Man and his Books.</i> By Edward Thomas.
Chapman and Hall, 1912.</p></div>

<p>All of these books have contributed something of value and importance to
the subject. Dr. Knapp's work it is easiest to praise because he is
dead.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His biography of Borrow was the effort of a lifetime. A scholar
with great linguistic qualifications for writing the biography of an
author whose knowledge of languages was one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> his titles to fame, Dr.
Knapp spared neither time nor money to achieve his purpose. Starting
with an article in <i>The Chautauquan Magazine</i> in 1887, which was
reprinted in pamphlet form, Dr. Knapp came to England&mdash;to Norwich&mdash;and
there settled down to write a <i>Life</i> of Borrow, which promised at one
time to develop into several volumes. As well it might, for Dr. Knapp
reached Norfolk at a happy moment for his purpose. Mrs. MacOubrey,
Borrow's stepdaughter, was in the humour to sell her father's
manuscripts and books. They were offered to the city of Norwich; there
was some talk of Mr. Jeremiah Coleman, M.P., whose influence and wealth
were overpowering in Norwich at the time, buying them. Finally, a very
considerable portion of the collection came into the hands of Mr.
Webber, a bookseller of Ipswich, who later became associated with the
firm of Jarrold of Norwich. From Webber Dr. Knapp purchased the larger
portion, and, as his bibliography indicates (<i>Life</i>, vol. ii. pp.
355-88), he became possessed of sundry notebooks which furnish a record
of certain of Borrow's holiday tours, about a hundred letters from and
to Borrow, and a considerable number of other documents. The result, as
I have indicated, was a book that abounded in new facts and is rich in
new material. It was not, however, a book for popular reading. You must
love the subject before you turn to this book with any zest. It is a
book for your true Borrovian, who is thankful for any information about
the word-master, not for the casual reader, who might indeed be
alienated from the subject by this copious memoir. The result was
somewhat discouraging. There were not enough of true Borrovians in those
years, and the book was not received too generously. The two volumes
have gone out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> print and have not reached a second edition. Time
however, will do them justice. As it is, your good Borrow lover has
always appreciated their merits. Take Lionel Johnson for example, a good
critic and a master of style. After saying that these 'lengthy and rich
volumes are a monument of love's labour, but not of literary art or
biographical skill,' he adds: 'Of his over eight hundred pages there is
not one for which I am not grateful' and every new biographer of Borrow
is bound to re-echo that sentiment. Dr. Knapp did the spade work and
other biographers have but entered into his inheritance. Dr. Knapp's
fine collection of Borrow books and manuscripts was handed over by his
widow to the American nation&mdash;to the Hispanic Society of New York. Dr.
Knapp's biography was followed nine years later by a small volume by Mr.
R. A. J. Walling, whose little book adds considerably to our knowledge
of Borrow's Cornish relatives, and is in every way a valuable monograph
on the author of <i>Lavengro</i>. Mr. Herbert Jenkins's book is more
ambitious. Within four hundred closely printed pages he has compressed
every incident in Borrow's career, and we would not quarrel with him nor
his publisher for calling his life a 'definitive biography' if one did
not know that there is not and cannot be anything 'definitive' about a
biography except in the case of a Master. Boswell, Lockhart, Mrs.
Gaskell are authors who had the advantage of knowing personally the
subjects of their biographies. Any biographer who has not met his hero
face to face and is dependent solely on documents is crippled in his
undertaking. Moreover, such a biographer is always liable to be in a
manner superseded or at least supplemented by the appearance of still
more documents. However, Mr. Jenkins's excellent biography has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
advantage of many new documents from Mr. John Murray's archives and from
the Record Office Manuscripts. His work was the first to make use of the
letters of George Borrow to the Bible Society, which the Rev. T. H.
Darlow has published as a book under that title, a book to which I owe
him an acknowledgment for such use of it as I have made, as also for
permission to reproduce the title-page of Borrow's Basque version of St.
Luke's gospel. There only remains for me to say a word in praise of Mr.
Edward Thomas's fine critical study of Borrow which was published under
the title of <i>George Borrow: The Man and his Books</i>. Mr. Thomas makes no
claim to the possession of new documents. This brings me to such excuse
as I can make for perpetrating a fifth biography. When Mrs. MacOubrey,
Borrow's stepdaughter, the 'Hen.' of <i>Wild Wales</i> and the affectionate
companion of his later years, sold her father's books and
manuscripts&mdash;and she always to her dying day declared that she had no
intention of parting with the manuscripts, which were, she said, taken
away under a misapprehension&mdash;she did not, of course, part with any of
his more private documents. All the more intimate letters of Borrow were
retained. At her death these passed to her executors, from whom I have
purchased all legal rights in the publication of Borrow's hitherto
unpublished manuscripts and letters. I trust that even to those who may
disapprove of the discursive method with which&mdash;solely for my own
pleasure&mdash;I have written this book, will at least find a certain
biographical value in the many new letters by and to George Borrow that
are to be found in its pages. The book has taken me ten years to write,
and has been a labour of love.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN BORROW OF THE WEST NORFOLK MILITIA</h3>


<p>George Henry Borrow was born at Dumpling Green near East Dereham,
Norfolk, on the 5th of July 1803. It pleased him to state on many an
occasion that he was born at East Dereham.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On an evening of July, in the year 18&mdash;, at East D&mdash;&mdash;, a
beautiful little town in a certain district of East Anglia, I
first saw the light,</p></div>

<p>he writes in the opening lines of <i>Lavengro</i>, using almost the identical
phraseology that we find in the opening lines of Goethe's <i>Wahrheit und
Dichtung</i>. Here is a later memory of Dereham from <i>Lavengro</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What it is at present I know not, for thirty years and more
have elapsed since I last trod its streets. It will scarcely
have improved, for how could it be better than it was? I love
to think on thee, pretty, quiet D&mdash;&mdash;, thou pattern of an
English country town, with thy clean but narrow streets
branching out from thy modest market-place, with their
old-fashioned houses, with here and there a roof of venerable
thatch, with thy one half-aristocratic mansion, where resided
the Lady Bountiful&mdash;she, the generous and kind, who loved to
visit the sick, leaning on her golden-headed cane, while the
sleek old footman walked at a respectful distance behind.
Pretty, quiet D&mdash;&mdash;, with thy venerable church, in which
moulder the mortal remains of England's sweetest and most pious
bard.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Then follows an exquisite eulogy of the poet Cowper, which readers of
<i>Lavengro</i> know full well. Three years before Borrow was born William
Cowper died in this very town, leaving behind him so rich a legacy of
poetry and of prose, and moreover so fragrant a memory of a life in
which humour and pathos played an equal part. It was no small thing for
a youth who aspired to any kind of renown to be born in the
neighbourhood of the last resting-place of the author of <i>The Task</i>.</p>

<p>Yet Borrow was not actually born in East Dereham, but a mile and a half
away, at the little hamlet of Dumpling Green, in what was then a
glorious wilderness of common and furze bush, but is now a quiet
landscape of fields and hedges. You will find the home in which the
author of <i>Lavengro</i> first saw the light without much difficulty. It is
a fair-sized farm-house, with a long low frontage separated from the
road by a considerable strip of garden. It suggests a prosperous yeoman
class, and I have known farm-houses in East Anglia not one whit larger
dignified by the name of 'hall.' Nearly opposite is a pond. The trim
hedges are a delight to us to-day, but you must cast your mind back to a
century ago when they were entirely absent. The house belonged to George
Borrow's maternal grandfather, Samuel Perfrement, who farmed the
adjacent land at this time. Samuel and Mary Perfrement had eight
children, the third of whom, Ann, was born in 1772.</p>

<p>In February 1793 Ann Perfrement, aged twenty-one, married Thomas Borrow,
aged thirty-five, in the Parish Church of East Dereham, and of the two
children that were born to them George Henry Borrow was the younger.
Thomas Borrow was the son of one John Borrow of St. Cleer in Cornwall,
who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> died before this child was born, and is described by his
grandson<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as the scion 'of an ancient but reduced
Cornish family,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
tracing descent from the de Burghs, and entitled to carry their arms.'
This claim, of which I am thoroughly sceptical, is endorsed by Dr.
Knapp,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who, however, could find no trace of the family earlier than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>1678, the old parish registers having been destroyed. When Thomas Borrow
was born the family were in any case nothing more than small farmers,
and Thomas Borrow and his brothers were working on the land in the
intervals of attending the parish school. At the age of eighteen Thomas
was apprenticed to a maltster at Liskeard, and about this time he joined
the local Militia. Tradition has it that his career as a maltster was
cut short by his knocking his master down in a scrimmage. The victor
fled from the scene of his prowess, and enlisted as a private soldier in
the Coldstream Guards. This was in 1783, and in 1792 he was transferred
to the West Norfolk Militia; hence his appearance at East Dereham,
where, now a serjeant, his occupations for many a year were recruiting
and drilling.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is recorded that at a theatrical performance at East
Dereham he first saw, presumably on the stage of the county-hall, his
future wife&mdash;Ann Perfrement. She was, it seems, engaged in a minor part
in a travelling company, not, we may assume, altogether with the
sanction of her father, who, in spite of his inheritance of French
blood, doubtless shared the then very strong English prejudice against
the stage. However, Ann was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> one of eight children, and had, as we shall
find in after years, no inconsiderable strength of character, and so may
well at twenty years of age have decided upon a career for herself. In
any case we need not press too hard the Cornish and French origin of
George Borrow to explain his wandering tendencies, nor need we wonder at
the suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne, that he was 'supposed to be of
gypsy descent by the mother's side.' You have only to think of the
father, whose work carried him from time to time to every corner of
England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of the mother with her reminiscence
of life in a travelling theatrical company, to explain in no small
measure the glorious vagabondage of George Borrow.</p>

<p>Behold then Thomas Borrow and Ann Perfrement as man and wife, he being
thirty-five years of age, she twenty-one. A roving, restless life was in
front of the pair for many a day, the West Norfolk Militia being
stationed in some eight or nine separate towns within the interval of
ten years between Thomas Borrow's marriage and his second son's birth.
The first child, John Thomas Borrow, was born on the 15th April 1801.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The second son, George Henry Borrow, the subject of this memoir, was
born in his grandfather's house at Dumpling Green, East Dereham, his
mother having found a natural refuge with her father while her husband
was busily recruiting in Norfolk. The two children passed with their
parents from place to place, and in 1809 we find them once again in
East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> Dereham. From his son's two books, <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Wild Wales</i>, we
can trace the father's later wanderings until his final retirement to
Norwich on a pension. In 1810 the family were at Norman Cross in
Huntingdonshire, when Captain Borrow had to assist in guarding the
French prisoners of war; for it was the stirring epoch of the Napoleonic
conflict, and within the temporary prison 'six thousand French and other
foreigners, followers of the Grand Corsican, were now immured.'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What a strange appearance had those mighty casernes, with their
blank blind walls, without windows or grating, and their
slanting roofs, out of which, through orifices where the tiles
had been removed, would be protruded dozens of grim heads,
feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide expanse of country
unfolded from that airy height. Ah! there was much misery in
those casernes; and from those roofs, doubtless, many a wistful
look was turned in the direction of lovely France. Much had the
poor inmates to endure, and much to complain of, to the
disgrace of England be it said&mdash;of England, in general so kind
and bountiful. Rations of carrion meat, and bread from which I
have seen the very hounds occasionally turn away, were unworthy
entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy, when helpless
and a captive; and such, alas! was the fare in those casernes.</p></div>

<p>But here we have only to do with Thomas Borrow, of whom we get many a
quaint glimpse in <i>Lavengro</i>, our first and our last being concerned
with him in the one quality that his son seems to have inherited, as the
associate of a prize-fighter&mdash;Big Ben Brain. Borrow records in his
opening chapter that Ben Brain and his father met in Hyde Park probably
in 1790, and that after an hour's conflict 'the champions shook hands
and retired, each having experienced quite enough of the other's
prowess.' Borrow further relates that four months afterwards Brain 'died
in the arms of my father, who read to him the Bible in his last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
moments.' Dr. Knapp finds Borrow in one of his many inaccuracies or
rather 'imaginings' here, as Brain did not die until 1794. More than
once in his after years the old soldier seems to have had a shy pride in
that early conflict, although the piety which seems to have come to him
with the responsibilities of wife and children led him to count any
recalling of the episode as a 'temptation.' When Borrow was about
thirteen years of age, he overheard his father and mother discussing
their two boys, the elder being the father's favourite and George the
mother's:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I will hear nothing against my first-born,' said my father,
'even in the way of insinuation: he is my joy and pride; the
very image of myself in my youthful days, long before I fought
Big Ben, though perhaps not quite so tall or strong built. As
for the other, God bless the child! I love him, I'm sure; but I
must be blind not to see the difference between him and his
brother. Why, he has neither my hair nor my eyes; and then his
countenance! why, 'tis absolutely swarthy, God forgive me! I
had almost said like that of a gypsy, but I have nothing to say
against that; the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his
face, nor for his hair and eyes; but, then, his ways and
manners!&mdash;I confess I do not like them, and that they give me
no little uneasiness.'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>Borrow throughout his narrative refers to his father as 'a man of
excellent common sense,' and he quotes the opinion of William Taylor,
who had rather a bad reputation as a 'freethinker' with all the
church-going citizens of Norwich, with no little pride. Borrow is of
course the 'young man' of the dialogue. He was then eighteen years of
age:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Not so, not so,' said the young man eagerly; 'before I knew
you I knew nothing, and am still very ignorant; but of late my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
father's health has been very much broken, and he requires
attention; his spirits also have become low, which, to tell you
the truth, he attributes to my misconduct. He says that I have
imbibed all kinds of strange notions and doctrines, which will,
in all probability, prove my ruin, both here and hereafter;
which&mdash;which&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah! I understand,' said the elder, with another calm whiff. 'I
have always had a kind of respect for your father, for there is
something remarkable in his appearance, something heroic, and I
would fain have cultivated his acquaintance; the feeling,
however, has not been reciprocated. I met him the other day, up
the road, with his cane and dog, and saluted him; he did not
return my salutation.'</p>

<p>'He has certain opinions of his own,' said the youth, 'which
are widely different from those which he has heard that you
profess.'</p>

<p>'I respect a man for entertaining an opinion of his own,' said
the elderly individual. 'I hold certain opinions; but I should
not respect an individual the more for adopting them. All I
wish for is tolerance, which I myself endeavour to practise. I
have always loved the truth, and sought it; if I have not found
it, the greater my misfortune.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p>When Borrow is twenty years of age we have another glimpse of father and
son, the father in his last illness, the son eager as usual to draw out
his parent upon the one subject that appeals to his adventurous spirit,
'I should like to know something about Big Ben,' he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'You are a strange lad,' said my father; 'and though of late I
have begun to entertain a more favourable opinion than
heretofore, there is still much about you that I do not
understand. Why do you bring up that name? Don't you know that
it is one of my temptations? You wish to know something about
him? Well, I will oblige you this once, and then farewell to
such vanities&mdash;something about him. I will tell you&mdash;his&mdash;skin
when he flung off his clothes&mdash;and he had a particular knack in
doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> so&mdash;his skin, when he bared his mighty chest and back
for combat; and when he fought he stood, so&mdash;if I remember
right&mdash;his skin, I say, was brown and dusky as that of a toad.
Oh me! I wish my elder son was here!'</p></div>

<p>Concerning the career of Borrow's father there seem to be no documents
other than one contained in <i>Lavengro</i>, yet no <i>Life of Borrow</i> can
possibly he complete that does not draw boldly upon the son's priceless
tributes. And so we come now to the last scene in the career of the
elder Borrow&mdash;his death-bed&mdash;which is also the last page of the first
volume of <i>Lavengro</i>. George Borrow's brother has arrived from abroad.
The little house in Willow Lane, Norwich, contained the mother and her
two sons sorrowfully awaiting the end, which came on 28th February 1824.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the dead hour of night&mdash;it might be about two&mdash;I was
awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from the room
immediately below that in which I slept. I knew the cry&mdash;it was
the cry of my mother; and I also knew its import, yet I made no
effort to rise, for I was for the moment paralysed. Again the
cry sounded, yet still I lay motionless&mdash;the stupidity of
horror was upon me. A third time, and it was then that, by a
violent effort, bursting the spell which appeared to bind me, I
sprang from the bed and rushed downstairs. My mother was
running wildly about the room; she had awoke and found my
father senseless in the bed by her side. I essayed to raise
him, and after a few efforts supported him in the bed in a
sitting posture. My brother now rushed in, and, snatching up a
light that was burning, he held it to my father's face. 'The
surgeon! the surgeon!' he cried; then, dropping the light, he
ran out of the room, followed by my mother; I remained alone,
supporting the senseless form of my father; the light had been
extinguished by the fall, and an almost total darkness reigned
in the room. The form pressed heavily against my bosom; at last
methought it moved. Yes, I was right; there was a heaving of
the breast, and then a gasping. Were those words which I heard?
Yes, they were words, low and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> indistinct at first, and then
audible. The mind of the dying man was reverting to former
scenes. I heard him mention names which I had often heard him
mention before. It was an awful moment; I felt stupefied, but I
still contrived to support my dying father. There was a pause;
again my father spoke: I heard him speak of Minden, and of
Meredith, the old Minden Serjeant, and then he uttered another
name, which at one period of his life was much on his lips, the
name of &mdash;&mdash;; but this is a solemn moment! There was a deep
gasp: I shook, and thought all was over; but I was mistaken&mdash;my
father moved, and revived for a moment; he supported himself in
bed without my assistance. I make no doubt that for a moment he
was perfectly sensible, and it was then that, clasping his
hands, he uttered another name clearly, distinctly&mdash;it was the
name of Christ. With that name upon his lips the brave old
soldier sank back upon my bosom, and, with his hands still
clasped, yielded up his soul.</p></div>

<p>Did Borrow's father ever really fight Big Ben Brain or Bryan in Hyde
Park, or is it all a fantasy of the artist's imagining? We shall never
know. Borrow called his <i>Lavengro</i> 'An Autobiography' at one stage of
its inception, although he wished to repudiate the autobiographical
nature of his story at another. Dr. Knapp in his anxiety to prove that
Borrow wrote his own memoirs in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i> tells us
that he had no creative faculty&mdash;an absurd proposition. But I think we
may accept the contest between Ben Brain and Thomas Borrow, and what a
revelation of heredity that impressive death-bed scene may be counted.
Borrow on one occasion in later life declared that his favourite hooks
were the Bible and the Newgate Calendar. We know that he specialised on
the Bible and Prize-Fighting in no ordinary fashion&mdash;and here we see his
father on his death-bed struggling between the religious sentiments of
his maturity and the one great worldly escapade of his early manhood.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In the year 1870 Borrow was asked for material for a
biography by the editor of <i>Men of the Time</i>, a publication which many
years later was incorporated in the present <i>Who's Who</i>. He drew up two
drafts in his own handwriting, which are so interesting, and yet vary so
much in certain particulars, that we are tempted to print both here, or
at least that part of the second draft that differs from the first. The
concluding passages of both drafts are alike. The biography as it stands
in the 1871 edition of <i>Men of the Time</i> appears to have been compiled
from the earlier of these drafts. It must have been another copy of

Norfolk in the early part of the present century. His father was a
military officer, with whom he travelled about most parts of the United
Kingdom. He was at some of the best schools in England, and also for
about two years at the High School at Edinburgh. In 1818 he was articled
to an eminent solicitor at Norwich, with whom he continued five years.
He did not, however, devote himself much to his profession, his mind
being much engrossed by philology, for which at a very early period he
had shown a decided inclination, having when in Ireland acquired the
Irish language. At the age of twenty he knew little of the law, but was
well versed in languages, being not only a good classical scholar but
acquainted with French, Italian, Spanish, all the Celtic and Gothic
dialects, and also with the peculiar language of the English Romany
Chals or Gypsies. This speech, which, though broken and scanty, exhibits
evident signs of high antiquity, he had picked up amongst the wandering
tribes with whom he had formed acquaintance on a wild heath near
Norwich, where they were in the habit of encamping. At the expiration of
his clerkship, which occurred shortly after the death of his father, he
betook himself to London, and endeavoured to get a livelihood by
literature. For some time he was a hack author. His health failing he
left London, and for a considerable time lived a life of roving
adventure. In the year 1833 he entered the service of he British and
Foreign Bible Society, and being sent to Russia edited at Saint
Petersburg the New Testament in the Manchu or Chinese Tartar. Whilst at
Saint Petersburg he published a book called <i>Targum</i>, consisting of
metrical translations from thirty languages. He was subsequently for
some years agent of the Bible Society in Spain, where he was twice
imprisoned for endeavouring to circulate the Gospel. In Spain he mingled
much with the Cal&oacute;re or Zincali, called by the Spaniards Gitanos or
Gypsies, whose language he found to be much the same as that of the
English Romany. At Madrid he edited the New Testament in Spanish, and
translated the Gospel of Saint Luke into the language of the Zincali.
Leaving the service of the Bible Society he returned to England in 1839,
and shortly afterwards married a Suffolk lady. In 1841 he published <i>The
Zincali</i>, or an account of the Gypsies of Spain, with a vocabulary of
their language, which he proved to be closely connected with the
Sanskrit. This work obtained almost immediately a European celebrity,
and was the cause of many learned works being published on the continent
on the subject of the Gypsies. In 1842 he gave to the world <i>The Bible
in Spain</i>, or an account of an attempt to circulate the Gospel in the
peninsula, a work which received a warm and eloquent eulogium from Sir
Robert Peel in the House of Commons. In 1844 he was wandering amongst
the Gypsies of Hungary, Walachia, and Turkey, gathering up the words of
their respective dialects of the Romany, and making a collection of
their songs. In 1851 he published <i>Lavengro</i>, in which he gives an
account of his early life, and in 1857 <i>The Romany Rye</i>, a sequel to the
same. His latest publication is <i>Wild Wales</i>. He has written many other
works, some of which are not yet published. He has an estate in Suffolk,
but spends the greater part of his time in wandering on foot through
various countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Draft II.</span>&mdash;George Henry Borrow was born at East Dereham in the county of
Norfolk on the 5th July 1803. His father, Thomas Borrow, who died
captain and adjutant of the West Norfolk Militia, was of an ancient but
reduced Cornish family, tracing descent from the de Burghs, and entitled
to carry their arms. His mother, Ann Perfrement, was a native of
Norfolk, and descended from a family of French Protestants banished from
France on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He was the youngest of
two sons. His brother, John Thomas, who was endowed with various and
very remarkable talents, died at an early age in Mexico. Both the
brothers had the advantage of being at some of the first schools in
Britain. The last at which they were placed was the Grammar School at
Norwich, to which town their father came to reside at the termination of
the French war. In the year 1818 George Borrow was articled to an
eminent solicitor in Norwich, with whom he continued five years. He did
not devote himself much to his profession, his mind being engrossed by
another and very different subject&mdash;namely philology, for which at a
very early period he had shown a decided inclination, having when in
Ireland with his father acquired the Irish language. At the expiration
of his clerkship he knew little of the law, but was well versed in
languages, being not only a good Greek and Latin scholar, but acquainted
with French, Italian, and Spanish, all the Celtic and Gothic dialects,
and likewise with the peculiar language of the English Romany Chals or
Gypsies. This speech or jargon, amounting to about eleven hundred and
twenty-seven words, he had picked up amongst the wandering tribes with
whom he had formed acquaintance on Mousehold, a wild heath near Norwich,
where they were in the habit of encamping. By the time his clerkship was
expired his father was dead, and he had little to depend upon but the
exercise of his abilities such as they were. In 1823 he betook himself
to London, and endeavoured to obtain a livelihood by literature. For
some time he was a hack author, doing common work for booksellers. For
one in particular he prepared an edition of the Newgate Calendar, from
the careful study of which he has often been heard to say that he first
learned to write genuine English. His health failed, he left London, and
for a considerable time he lived a life of roving adventure.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>BORROW'S MOTHER</h3>


<p>Throughout his whole life George Borrow adored his mother, who seems to
have developed into a woman of great strength of character far remote
from the pretty play-actor who won the heart of a young soldier at East
Dereham in the last years of the eighteenth century. We would gladly
know something of the early years of Ann Perfrement. Her father was a
farmer, whose farm at Dumpling Green we have already described. He did
not, however, 'farm his own little estate' as Borrow declared. The
grandfather&mdash;a French Protestant&mdash;came, if we are to believe Borrow,
from Caen in Normandy after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but
there is no documentary evidence to support the contention. However, the
story of the Huguenot immigration into England is clearly bound up with
Norwich and the adjacent district. And so we may well take the name of
'Perfrement' as conclusive evidence of a French origin, and reject as
utterly untenable the not unnatural suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne,
that Borrow's mother was 'of gypsy descent.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> She was one of the eight
children of Samuel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> and Mary Perfrement, all of whom seem to have
devoted their lives to East Anglia.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We owe to Dr. Knapp's edition of
<i>Lavengro</i> one exquisite glimpse of Ann's girlhood that is not in any
other issue of the book. Ann's elder sister, curious to know if she was
ever to be married, falls in with the current superstition that she must
wash her linen and 'watch' it drying before the fire between eleven and
twelve at night. Ann Perfrement was ten years old at the time. The two
girls walked over to East Dereham, purchased the necessary garment,
washed it in the pool near the house that may still be seen, and watched
and watched. Suddenly when the clock struck twelve they heard, or
thought they heard, a footstep on the path, the wind howled, and the
elder sister sprang to the door, locked and bolted it, and then fell in
convulsions on the floor. The superstition, which Borrow seems to have
told his mother had a Danish origin, is common enough in Ireland and in
Celtic lands. It could scarcely have been thus rehearsed by two Norfolk
children had they not had the blood of a more imaginative race in their
veins. In addition to this we find more than one effective glimpse of
Borrow's mother in <i>Lavengro</i>. We have already noted the episode in
which she takes the side of her younger boy against her husband, with
whom John was the favourite. We meet her again in the following
dialogue, with its pathetic allusions to Dante and to the complaint&mdash;a
kind of nervous exhaustion which he called 'the horrors'&mdash;that was to
trouble Borrow all his days:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'What ails you, my child?' said a mother to her son, as he lay
on a couch under the influence of the dreadful one; 'what ails
you? you seem afraid!'</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> And so I am; a dreadful fear is upon me.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> But of what? there is no one can harm you; of what
are you apprehensive?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Of nothing that I can express. I know not what I am
afraid of, but afraid I am.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Perhaps you see sights and visions. I knew a lady
once who was continually thinking that she saw an armed man
threaten her, but it was only an imagination, a phantom of the
brain.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> No armed man threatens me; and 'tis not a thing like
that would cause me any fear. Did an armed man threaten me I
would get up and fight him; weak as I am, I would wish for
nothing better, for then, perhaps, I should lose this fear;
mine is a dread of I know not what, and there the horror lies.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Your forehead is cool, and your speech collected. Do
you know where you are?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> I know where I am, and I see things just as they are;
you are beside me, and upon the table there is a book which was
written by a Florentine; all this I see, and that there is no
ground for being afraid. I am, moreover, quite cool, and feel
no pain&mdash;but, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then there was a burst of 'gemiti, sospiri ed alti guai.'
Alas, alas, poor child of clay! as the sparks fly upward, so
wast thou born to sorrow&mdash;Onward!<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></div>

<p>Our next glimpse of Mrs. Borrow is when after his father's death George
had shouldered his knapsack and made his way to London to seek his
fortune by literature. His elder brother had remained at home,
determined upon being a painter, but joined George in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> London, leaving
the widowed mother momentarily alone in Norwich.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'And how are things going on at home?' said I to my brother,
after we had kissed and embraced. 'How is my mother, and how is
the dog?'</p>

<p>'My mother, thank God, is tolerably well,' said my brother,
'but very much given to fits of crying. As for the dog, he is
not so well; but we will talk more of these matters anon,' said
my brother, again glancing at the breakfast things. 'I am very
hungry, as you may suppose, after having travelled all night.'</p>

<p>Thereupon I exerted myself to the best of my ability to perform
the duties of hospitality, and I made my brother welcome&mdash;I may
say more than welcome; and when the rage of my brother's hunger
was somewhat abated, we recommenced talking about the matters
of our little family, and my brother told me much about my
mother; he spoke of her fits of crying, but said that of late
the said fits of crying had much diminished, and she appeared
to be taking comfort; and, if I am not much mistaken, my
brother told me that my mother had of late the prayer-book
frequently in her hand, and yet oftener the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>Ann Borrow lived in Willow Lane, Norwich, for thirty-three years. That
Borrow was a devoted husband these pages will show. He was also a
devoted son. When he had made a prosperous marriage he tried hard to
persuade his mother to live with him at Oulton, but all in vain. She had
the wisdom to see that such an arrangement is rarely conducive to a
son's domestic happiness. She continued to live in the little cottage
made sacred by many associations until almost the end of her days. Here
she had lived in earlier years with her husband and her two ambitious
boys, and in Norwich, doubtless, she had made her own friendships,
although of these no record remains. The cottage still stands in its
modest court, but is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> at the moment untenanted. There is a letter extant
from Cecilia Lucy Brightwell, who wrote <i>The Life of Mrs. Opie</i>, to Mary
Borrow at Oulton, when Mrs. Borrow the elder had gone to live there,
which records the fact that in 1851, two years after Mrs. Borrow had
left the cottage in Willow Lane, it had already changed its appearance.
Mrs. Brightwell writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Give my kind love to dear mother. Tell her I went past her
house to-day and looked up the court. It is quite changed: all
the trees and the ivy taken away.</p></div>

<p>The house was the property of Thomas King, a carpenter. You enter from
Willow Lane through a covered passage into what was then known as King's
Court. Here the little house faces you, and you meet it with a
peculiarly agreeable sensation, recalling more than one incident in
<i>Lavengro</i> that transpired there. In 1897 the then mayor made the one
attempt of his city of a whole half century to honour Borrow by calling
this court Borrow's Court&mdash;thereby conferring a ridiculously small
distinction upon Borrow,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and removing a landmark connected with one
of its own worthy citizens. For Thomas King, the carpenter, was in
direct descent in the maternal line from the family of Parker, which
gave to Norwich one of its most distinguished sons in the famous
Archbishop of Queen Elizabeth's day. He extended his business as
carpenter sufficiently to die a prosperous builder. Of his two sons one,
also named Thomas, became physician to Prince Talleyrand, and married a
sister of John Stuart Mill.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> All this by the way, but there is little
more to record of Borrow's mother apart from the letters addressed to
her by her son, which occur in their due place in these records. Yet one
little memorandum among my papers which bears Mrs. Borrow's signature
may well find place here:</p>

<h3>JOHN THOMAS BORROW</h3>


<p>John Thomas Borrow was born two years before his younger brother, that
is, on the 15th April 1801. His father, then Serjeant Borrow, was
wandering from town to town, and it is not known where his elder son
first saw the light. John Borrow's nature was cast in a somewhat
different mould from that of his brother. He was his father's pride.
Serjeant Borrow could not understand George with his extraordinary taste
for the society of queer people&mdash;the wild Irish and the ragged Romanies.
John had far more of the normal in his being. Borrow gives us in
<i>Lavengro</i> our earliest glimpse of his brother:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He was a beautiful child; one of those occasionally seen in
England, and in England alone; a rosy, angelic face, blue eyes,
and light chestnut hair; it was not exactly an Anglo-Saxon
countenance, in which, by the by, there is generally a cast of
loutishness and stupidity; it partook, to a certain extent, of
the Celtic character, particularly in the fire and vivacity
which illumined it; his face was the mirror of his mind;
perhaps no disposition more amiable was ever found amongst the
children of Adam, united, however, with no inconsiderable
portion of high and dauntless spirit. So great was his beauty
in infancy, that people, especially those of the poorer
classes, would follow the nurse who carried him about in order
to look at and bless his lovely face. At the age of three
months an attempt was made to snatch him from his mother's arms
in the streets of London, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> the moment she was about to enter
a coach; indeed, his appearance seemed to operate so powerfully
upon every person who beheld him, that my parents were under
continual apprehension of losing him; his beauty, however, was
perhaps surpassed by the quickness of his parts. He mastered
his letters in a few hours, and in a day or two could decipher
the names of people on the doors of houses and over the
shop-windows.</p></div>

<p>John received his early education at the Norwich Grammar School, while
the younger brother was kept under the paternal wing. Father and mother,
with their younger boy George, were always on the move, passing from
county to county and from country to country, as Serjeant Borrow, soon
to be Captain, attended to his duties of drilling and recruiting, now in
England, now in Scotland, now in Ireland. We are given a fascinating
glimpse of John Borrow in <i>Lavengro</i> by way of a conversation between
Mr. and Mrs. Borrow over the education of their children. It was agreed
that while the family were in Edinburgh the boys should be sent to the
High School, and so at the historic school that Sir Walter Scott had
attended a generation before the two boys were placed, John being
removed from the Norwich Grammar School for the purpose. Among his many
prejudices of after years Borrow's dislike of Scott was perhaps the most
regrettable, otherwise he would have gloried in the fact that their
childhood had had one remarkable point in common. Each boy took part in
the feuds between the Old Town and the New Town. Exactly as Scott
records his prowess at 'the manning of the Cowgate Port,' and the
combats maintained with great vigour, 'with stones, and sticks, and
fisticuffs,' as set forth in the first volume of Lockhart, so we have
not dissimilar feats set down in <i>Lavengro</i>. Side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> by side also with the
story of 'Green-Breeks,' which stands out in Scott's narrative of his
school combats, we have the more lurid account by Borrow of David
Haggart. Literary biography is made more interesting by such episodes of
likeness and of contrast.</p>

<p>We next find John Borrow in Ireland with his father, mother, and
brother. George is still a child, but he is precocious enough to be
learning the language, and thus laying the foundation of his interest in
little-known tongues. John is now an ensign in his father's regiment.
'Ah! he was a sweet being, that boy soldier, a plant of early promise,
bidding fair to become in after time all that is great, good, and
admirable.' Ensign John tells his little brother how pleased he is to
find himself, although not yet sixteen years old, 'a person in authority
with many Englishmen under me. Oh! these last six weeks have passed like
hours in heaven.' That was in 1816, and we do not meet John again until
five years later, when we hear of him rushing into the water to save a
drowning man, while twenty others were bathing who might have rendered
assistance. Borrow records once again his father's satisfaction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'My boy, my own boy, you are the very image of myself, the day
I took off my coat in the park to fight Big Ben,' said my
father, on meeting his son, wet and dripping, immediately after
his bold feat. And who cannot excuse the honest pride of the
old man&mdash;the stout old man?</p></div>

<p>In the interval the war had ended, and Napoleon had departed for St.
Helena. Peace had led to the pensioning of militia officers, or reducing
to half-pay of the juniors. The elder Borrow had settled in Norwich.
George was set to study at the Grammar School there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> while his brother
worked in Old Crome's studio, for here was a moment when Norwich had its
interesting Renaissance, and John Borrow was bent on being an artist. He
had worked with Crome once before&mdash;during the brief interval that
Napoleon was at Elba&mdash;but now he set to in real earnest, and we have
evidence of a score of pictures by him that were catalogued In the
exhibitions of the Norwich Society of Artists between the years 1817 and
1824. They include one portrait of the artist's father, and two of his
brother George.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Old Crome died in 1821, and then John went to London
to study under Haydon. Borrow declares that his brother had real taste
for painting, and that 'if circumstances had not eventually diverted his
mind from the pursuit, he would have attained excellence, and left
behind him some enduring monument of his powers,' 'He lacked, however,'
he tells us, 'one thing, the want of which is but too often fatal to the
sons of genius, and without which genius is little more than a splendid
toy in the hands of the possessor&mdash;perseverance, dogged perseverance.'
It is when he is thus commenting on his brother's characteristics that
Borrow gives his own fine if narrow eulogy of Old Crome. John Borrow
seems to have continued his studies in London under Haydon for a year,
and then to have gone to Paris to copy pictures at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> Louvre. He
mentions a particular copy that he made of a celebrated picture by one
of the Italian masters, for which a Hungarian nobleman paid him well.
His three years' absence was brought to an abrupt termination by news of
his father's illness. He returned to Norwich in time to stand by that
father's bedside when he died. The elder Borrow died, as we have seen,
in February 1824. The little home in King's Court was kept on for the
mother, and as John was making money by his pictures it was understood
that he should stay with her. On the 1st April, however, George started
for London, carrying the manuscript of <i>Romantic Ballads from the
Danish</i> to Sir Richard Phillips, the publisher. On the 29th of the same
month he was joined by his brother John. John had come to London at his
own expense, but in the interests of the Norwich Town Council. The
council wanted a portrait of one of its mayors for St. Andrew's
Hall&mdash;that Valhalla of Norwich municipal worthies which still strikes
the stranger as well-nigh unique in the city life of England. The
municipality would fain have encouraged a fellow-citizen, and John
Borrow had been invited to paint the portrait. 'Why,' it was asked,
'should the money go into a stranger's pocket and be spent in London?'
John, however, felt diffident of his ability and declined, and this in
spite of the fact that the &pound;100 offered for the portrait must have been
very tempting. 'What a pity it was,' he said, 'that Crome was dead.'
'Crome,' said the orator of the deputation that had called on John
Borrow,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Crome; yes, he was a clever man, a very clever man, in his
way; he was good at painting landscapes and farm-houses, but he
would not do in the present instance, were he alive. He had no
conception of the heroic, sir. We want some person capable of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
representing our mayor standing under the Norman arch of the
cathedral.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>At the mention of the heroic John bethought himself of Haydon, and
suggested his name; hence his visit to London, and his proposed
interview with Haydon. The two brothers went together to call upon the
'painter of the heroic' at his studio in Connaught Terrace, Hyde Park.
There was some difficulty about their admission, and it turned out
afterwards that Haydon thought they might be duns, as he was very hard
up at the time. His eyes glistened at the mention of the &pound;100. 'I am not
very fond of painting portraits,' he said, 'but a mayor is a mayor, and
there is something grand in that idea of the Norman arch.' And thus
Mayor Hawkes came to be painted by Benjamin Haydon, and his portrait may
be found, not without diligent search, among the many municipal worthies
that figure on the walls of that most picturesque old Hall in Norwich.
Here is Borrow's description of the painting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The original mayor was a mighty, portly man, with a bull's
head, black hair, body like that of a dray horse, and legs and
thighs corresponding; a man six foot high at the least. To his
bull's head, black hair, and body the painter had done justice;
there was one point, however, in which the portrait did not
correspond with the original&mdash;the legs were disproportionably
short, the painter having substituted his own legs for those of
the mayor.</p></div>

<p>John Borrow described Robert Hawkes to his brother as a person of many
qualifications:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&mdash;big and portly, with a voice like Boanerges; a religious man,
the possessor of an immense pew; loyal, so much so that I once
heard him say that he would at any time go three miles to hear
any one sing 'God save the King'; moreover, a giver of
excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> dinners. Such is our present mayor, who, owing to
his loyalty, his religion, and a little, perhaps, to his
dinners, is a mighty favourite.</p></div>

<p>Haydon, who makes no mention of the Borrows in his <i>Correspondence</i> or
<i>Autobiography</i>, although there is one letter of George Borrow's to him
in the latter work, had been in jail for debt three years prior to the
visit of the Borrows. He was then at work on his greatest success in
'the heroic'&mdash;<i>The Raising of Lazarus</i>, a canvas nineteen feet long by
fifteen high. The debt was one to house decorators, for the artist had
ever large ideas. The bailiff, he tells us,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was so agitated at the
sight of the painting of Lazarus in the studio that he cried out, 'Oh,
my God! Sir, I won't arrest you. Give me your word to meet me at twelve
at the attorney's, and I'll take it.' In 1821 Haydon married, and a
little later we find him again 'without a single shilling in the
world&mdash;with a large picture before me not half done.' In April 1822 he
is arrested at the instance of his colourman, 'with whom I had dealt for
fifteen years,' and in November of the same year he is arrested again at
the instance of 'a miserable apothecary.' In April 1823 we find him in
the King's Bench Prison, from which he was released in July. <i>The
Raising of Lazarus</i> meanwhile had gone to pay his upholsterer &pound;300, and
his <i>Christ's Entry into Jerusalem</i> had been sold for &pound;240, although it
had brought him &pound;3000 in receipts at exhibitions. Clearly heroic
pictures did not pay, and Haydon here took up 'the torment of
portrait-painting' as he called it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Can you wonder,' he wrote in July 1825, 'that I nauseate
portraits, except portraits of clever people. I feel quite
convinced that every portrait-painter, if there be purgatory,
will leap at once to heaven, without this previous
purification.'</p></div>

<p>Perhaps it was Mayor Hawkes who helped to inspire this feeling.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Yet
the hundred pounds that John Borrow was able to procure must have been a
godsend, for shortly before this we find him writing in his diary of the
desperation that caused him to sell his books. 'Books that had cost me
&pound;20 I got only &pound;3 for. But it was better than starvation.' Indeed it was
in April of this year that the very baker was 'insolent,' and so in May
1824, as we learn from Tom Taylor's <i>Life</i>, he produced 'a full-length
portrait of Mr. Hawkes, a late Mayor of Norwich, painted for St.
Andrew's Hall in that city.' But I must leave Haydon's troubled career,
which closes so far as the two brothers are concerned with a letter from
George to Haydon written the following year from 26 Bryanston Street,
Portman Square:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I should feel extremely obliged if you would allow
me to sit to you as soon as possible. I am going to the south
of France in little better than a fortnight, and I would sooner
lose a thousand pounds than not have the honour of appearing in
the picture.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow</span>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>As Borrow was at the time in a most impoverished condition, it is not
easy to believe that he would have wished to be taken at his word. He
certainly had not a thousand pounds to lose. But he did undoubtedly, as
we shall see, take that journey on foot through the south of France,
after the manner of an earlier vagabond of literature&mdash;Oliver Goldsmith.
Haydon was to be far too much taken up with his own troubles during the
coming months to think any more about the Borrows when he had once
completed the portrait of the mayor, which he had done by July of this
year. Borrow's letter to him is, however, an obvious outcome of a remark
dropped by the painter on the occasion of his one visit to his studio
when the following conversation took place:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I'll stick to the heroic,' said the painter; 'I now and then
dabble in the comic, but what I do gives me no pleasure, the
comic is so low; there is nothing like the heroic. I am engaged
here on a heroic picture,' said he, pointing to the canvas;
'the subject is "Pharaoh dismissing Moses from Egypt," after
the last plague&mdash;the death of the first-born,&mdash;it is not far
advanced&mdash;that finished figure is Moses': they both looked at
the canvas, and I, standing behind, took a modest peep. The
picture, as the painter said, was not far advanced, the Pharaoh
was merely in outline; my eye was, of course, attracted by the
finished figure, or rather what the painter had called the
finished figure; but, as I gazed upon it, it appeared to me
that there was something defective&mdash;something unsatisfactory in
the figure. I concluded, however, that the painter,
notwithstanding what he had said, had omitted to give it the
finishing touch. 'I intend this to be my best picture,' said
the painter; 'what I want now is a face for Pharaoh; I have
long been meditating on a face for Pharaoh.' Here, chancing to
cast his eye upon my countenance, of whom he had scarcely taken
any manner of notice, he remained with his mouth open for some
time, 'Who is this?' said he at last. 'Oh, this is my brother,
I forgot to introduce him&mdash;&mdash;.'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>We wish that the acquaintance had extended further, but this was not to
be. Borrow was soon to commence the wanderings which were to give him
much unsatisfactory fame, and the pair never met again. Let us, however,
return to John Borrow, who accompanied Haydon to Norwich, leaving his
brother for some time longer to the tender mercies of Sir Richard
Phillips. John, we judge, seems to have had plenty of shrewdness, and
was not without a sense of his own limitations. A chance came to him of
commercial success in a distant land, and he seized that chance. A
Norwich friend, Allday Kerrison, had gone out to Mexico, and writing
from Zacatecas in 1825 asked John to join him. John accepted. His salary
in the service of the Real del Monte Company was to be &pound;300 per annum.
He sailed for Mexico in 1826, having obtained from his Colonel, Lord
Orford, leave of absence for a year, it being understood that renewals
of that leave of absence might be granted. He was entitled to half-pay
as a Lieutenant of the West Norfolk Militia, and this he settled upon
his mother during his absence. His career in Mexico was a failure. There
are many of his letters to his mother and brother extant which tell of
the difficulties of his situation. He was in three Mexican companies in
succession, and was about to be sent to Columbia to take charge of a
mine when he was stricken with a fever, and died at Guanajuato on 22nd
November 1838. He had far exceeded any leave that his Colonel could in
fairness grant, and before his death his name had been taken off the
army rolls. The question of his pay produced a long correspondence,
which can be found in the archives of the Rolls Office. I have the
original drafts of these letters in Borrow's handwriting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> The first
letter by Borrow is dated 8th September 1831; it is better to give the
correspondence in its order.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The letters speak for themselves, and

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I take the liberty of troubling you with these lines for
the purpose of enquiring whether there is any objection to the
issuing of the disembodied allowance of my brother Lieut. John
Borrow of the Welsh Norfolk Militia, who is at present abroad.
I do this by the advice of the Army Pay Office, a power of
Attorney having been granted to me by Lieut. Borrow to receive
the said allowance for him. I beg leave to add that my brother
was present at the last training of his regiment, that he went
abroad with the leave of his Commanding Officer, which leave of
absence has never been recalled, that he has sent home the
necessary affidavits, and that there is no clause in the Pay

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Willow Lane, Norwich</span>, <i>17th Septr. 1831.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have to acknowledge the receipt of No. 33,063, dated
16th inst., from the War Office, in which I am informed that
the Office does not feel authorized to give instructions for
the issue of the arrears of disembodied allowance claimed by my
brother Lieut. Borrow of the West Norfolk, until he attend the
next training of his regiment, and I now beg leave to ask the
following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> question, and to request that I may receive an
answer with all convenient speed. What farther right to his
<i>present</i> arrears of disembodied allowance will Lieut. Borrow's
appearance at the <i>next training</i> of his regiment confer upon
him, and provided there is no authority at present for ordering
the payment of those arrears, by what authority will the War
Office issue instructions for the payment of the same, after
his arrival in this country and attendance at the training?
Sir, provided Lieut. Borrow is not entitled to his arrears of
disembodied allowance at the present moment, he will be
entitled to them at no future period, and I was to the last
degree surprised at the receipt of an answer which tends to
involve the office in an inextricable dilemma, for it is in
fact a full acknowledgment of the justice of Lieutenant
Borrow's claims, and a refusal to satisfy them until a certain
time, which instantly brings on the question, 'By what
authority does the War Office seek to detain the disembodied
allowance of an officer, to which he is entitled by Act of
Parliament, a moment after it has become due and is legally
demanded?' If it be objected that it is not legally demanded, I
reply that the affidavits filled up in the required form are in
the possession of the Pay Office, and also a power of Attorney
in the Spanish language, together with a Notarial translation,
which power of Attorney has been declared by the Solicitor of
the Treasury to be legal and sufficient. To that part of the
Official letter relating to my brother's appearance at the next
training I have to reply, that I believe he is at present lying
sick in the Mountains above Vera Cruz, the pest-house of the
New World, and that the last time I heard from him I was
informed that it would be certain death for him to descend into
the level country, even were he capable of the exertion, for
the fever was then raging there. Full six months have elapsed
since he prepared to return to his native country, having
received information that there was a probability that his
regiment would be embodied, (but) the hand of God overtook him
on his route. He is the son, Sir, of an Officer who served his
King abroad and at home for upwards of half a century; he had
intended his disembodied allowance for the use of his widowed
and infirm mother, but it must now be transmitted to him for
his own support until he can arrive in England. But, Sir, I do
not wish to excite compassion in his behalf, all I request is
that he may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> have justice done him, and if it be, I shall be
informed in the next letter, that the necessary order has been
given to the Pay Office for the issue of his arrears. I have
the honor to remain, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Not having been favoured with an answer to the letter
which I last addressed to you concerning the arrears of
disembodied allowance due to Lieut. John Borrow of the West
Norfolk Militia, I again take the liberty of submitting this
matter to your consideration. More than six months have elapsed
since by virtue of a power of attorney granted to me by Lieut.
Borrow, I made demand at the army Pay Office for a portion of
those arrears, being the amount of two affidavits which were
produced, but owing to the much unnecessary demur which ensued,
chiefly with respect to the power of Attorney, since declared
to be valid, that demand has not hitherto been satisfied. I
therefore am compelled to beg that an order may be issued to
the Pay Office for the payment to me of the sums specified in
the said affidavits, that the amount may be remitted to Lieut.
Borrow, he being at present in great need thereof. If it be
answered that Lieut. Borrow was absent at the last training of
his regiment, and that he is not entitled to any arrears of
pay, I must beg leave to observe that the demand was legally
made many months previous to the said training, and cannot now
be set aside by his non-appearance, which arose from
unavoidable necessity; he having for the last year been lying
sick in one of the provinces of New Spain. And now, Sir, I will
make bold to inquire whether Lieut. Borrow, the son of an
Officer, who served his country abroad and at home, for upwards
of fifty years, is to lose his commission for being incapable,
from a natural visitation, of attending at the training; if it
be replied in the affirmative, I have only to add that his case
will be a cruelly hard one. But I hope and trust, Sir, that
taking all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> these circumstances into consideration you will not
<i>yet</i> cause his name to be stricken off the list, and that you
will permit him to retain his commission in the event of his
arriving in England with all the speed which his health of body
will permit, and that to enable him so to do his arrears<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
you will forthwith give an order for the payment of his
arrears. I have the honor to be, Sir, your very humble servant,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just received a letter from my brother Lieutenant
J. Borrow, from which it appears he has had leave of absence
from his Colonel, the Earl of Orford, up to the present year.
He says 'in a letter dated Wolterton, 21st June 1828, Lord
Orford writes: "should you want a further leave I will not
object to it." 20th May 1829 says: "I am much obliged to you
for a letter of the 18th March, and shall be glad to allow you
leave of absence for a twelvemonth." I enclose his last letter
from Brussels, August 6, 1829. At the end it gives very evident
proof that my remaining in Mexico <i>was not only by his
Lordship's permission, but even by his advice</i>. Sir, if you
should require it I will transmit this last letter of the Earl
of Orford's, which my brother has sent to me, but beg leave to
observe that no blame can be attached to his Lordship in this
case, he having from a multiplicity of important business
doubtless forgotten these minor matters. I hope now, Sir, that
you will have no further objection to issue an order for the
payment of that portion of my brother's arrears specified in
the two affidavits in the possession of the Paymaster General.
By the unnecessary obstacles which have been flung in my
brother's way in obtaining his arrears he has been subjected to
great inconvenience and distress. An early answer on this point
will much oblige, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I take the liberty of addressing you for the purpose of
requesting that an order be given to the Paymaster General for
the issue of the arrears of pay of my brother Lieutenant John
Borrow of the West Norfolk Militia, whose agent I am by virtue
of certain powers of Attorney, and also for the continuance of
the payment of his disembodied allowance. Lieutenant Borrow was
not present at the last training of his Regiment, being in
Mexico at the time, and knowing nothing of the matter. I beg
leave to observe that no official nor other letter was
dispatched to him by the adjutant to give him notice of the
event, nor was I, his agent, informed of it, he therefore
cannot have forfeited his arrears and disembodied allowance. He
was moreover for twelve months previous to the training, and
still is, so much indisposed from the effects of an attack of
the yellow fever, that his return would be attended with great
danger, which can be proved by the certificate of a Medical
Gentleman practising in Norwich, who was consulted from Mexico.
Lieutenants Harper and Williams, of the same Regiment, have
recovered their pay and arrears, although absent at the last
training, therefore it is clear and manifest that no objection
can be made to Lieut. Borrow's claim, who went abroad with his
Commanding Officer's permission, which those Gentlemen did not.
In conclusion I have to add that I have stated nothing which I
cannot substantiate, and that I court the most minute scrutiny
into the matter. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most
obedient and most humble servant,</p></div>

<p>The last of these letters is in another handwriting than that of Borrow,
who by this time had started for St. Petersburg for the Bible Society.
The officials were adamant. To one letter the War Office replied that
they could not consider any claims until Lieutenant Borrow of the West
Norfolk Militia should have arrived in England to attend the training of
his regiment. These five letters are, as we have said, in the Rolls
Office, although the indefatigable Professor Knapp seems to have dropped
across only two of them there. Their chief interest is in that they are
the earliest in order of date of the hitherto known letters of Borrow.
There is one further letter on the subject written somewhat later by old
Mrs. Borrow. She also appeals to the War Office for her son's
allowance.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It would seem clear that the arrears were never paid.</p>

training. The amount is a matter of great importance to me in
my very limited circumstances, having been at considerable
expense in fitting him out, which, though at the time it
occasioned me much pecuniary inconvenience, I thought it my
duty to exert all my means to accomplish, my present distress
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> mind is the greater having to struggle with my feelings
without the consolation and advice of my son George, who is at
this time at St. Petersburg. Your Lordship will, I trust,
pardon the liberty I am taking, and the trouble I am giving,
and allow for the feelings of an afflicted mother. I have the
honor to be your Lordship's most obedient servant,</p></div>

<p>I have said that there are letters of John Borrow's extant. Fragments of
these will be found in Dr. Knapp's book. These show a keen intelligence,
great practicality, and common sense. George&mdash;in 1829&mdash;had asked his
brother as to joining him in Mexico. 'If the country is soon settled I
shall say "yes,"' John answers. With equal wisdom he says to his
brother, 'Do not enter the army; it is a bad spec.' In this same year,
1829, John writes to ask whether his mother and brother are 'still
living in that windy house of old King's; it gives me the rheumatism to
think of it.' In 1830 he writes to his mother that he wishes his brother
were making money. 'Neither he nor I have any luck, he works hard and
remains poor.' In February of 1831 John writes to George suggesting that
he should endeavour to procure a commission in the regiment, and in July
of the same year to try the law again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am convinced that your want of success in life is more owing
to your being unlike other people than to any other cause.</p></div>

<p>John, as we have seen, died in Mexico of fever. George was at St.
Petersburg working for the Bible Society when his mother writes from
Norwich to tell him the news. John had died on 22nd November 1833. 'You
are now my only hope,' she writes, ' ... do not grieve, my dear George.
I trust we shall all meet in heaven. Put a crape on your hat for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> some
time.' Had George Borrow's brother lived it might have meant very much
in his life. There might have been nephews and nieces to soften the
asperity of his later years. Who can say? Meanwhile, <i>Lavengro</i> contains
no happier pages than those concerned with this dearly loved brother.</p>

<h3>A WANDERING CHILDHOOD</h3>


<p>We do not need to inquire too deeply as to Borrow's possible gypsy
origin in order to account for his vagabond propensities. The lives of
his parents before his birth, and the story of his own boyhood,
sufficiently account for the dominant tendency in Borrow. His father and
mother were married in 1793. Almost every year they changed their
domicile. In 1801 a son was born to them&mdash;they still continued to change
their domicile. Captain Borrow followed his regiment from place to
place, and his family accompanied him on these journeys. Dover,
Colchester, Sandgate, Canterbury, Chelmsford&mdash;these are some of the
towns where the Borrows sojourned. It was the merest accident&mdash;the Peace
of Amiens, to be explicit&mdash;that led them back to East Dereham in 1803,
so that the second son was born in his grandfather's house. George was
only a month old when he was carried off to Colchester; in 1804 he was
in the barracks of Kent, in 1805 of Sussex, in 1806 at Hastings, in 1807
at Canterbury, and so on. The indefatigable Dr. Knapp has recorded every
detail for all who love the minute, the meticulous, in biography. The
whole of the first thirteen years of Borrow's life is filled up in this
way, until in 1816 he and his parents found a home of some permanence in
Norwich. In 1809-10 they were at East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Dereham, in 1810-11 at Norman
Cross, in 1812 wandering from Harwich to Sheffield, and in 1813
wandering from Sheffield to Edinburgh; in 1814 they were in Norwich, and
in 1815-16 in Ireland. In this last year they returned to Norwich, the
father to retire on full pay, and to live in Willow Lane until his
death. How could a boy, whose first twelve years of life had been made
up of such continual wandering, have been other than a restless,
nomad-loving man, envious of the free life of the gypsies, for whom
alone in later life he seemed to have kindliness? Those twelve years are
to most boys merely the making of a moral foundation for good or ill; to
Borrow they were everything, and at least four personalities captured
his imagination during that short span, as we see if we follow his
juvenile wanderings more in detail to Dereham, Norman Cross, Edinburgh,
and Clonmel, and the personalities are Lady Fenn, Ambrose Smith, David
Haggart, and Murtagh. Let us deal with each in turn:</p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">East Dereham and Lady Fenn.</span>&mdash;In our opening chapter we referred to
the lines in <i>Lavengro</i>, where Borrow recalls his early impressions of
his native town, or at least the town in the neighbourhood of the hamlet
in which he was born. Borrow, we may be sure, would have repudiated
'Dumpling Green' if he could. The name had a humorous suggestion. To
this day they call boys from Norfolk 'Norfolk Dumplings' in the
neighbouring shires. But East Dereham was something to be proud of. In
it had died the writer who, through the greater part of Borrow's life,
remained the favourite poet of that half of England which professed the
Evangelical creed in which Borrow was brought up. Cowper was buried here
by the side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> Mary Unwin, and every Sunday little George would see his
tomb just as Henry Kingsley was wont to see the tombs in Chelsea Old
Church. The fervour of devotion to Cowper's memory that obtained in
those early days must have been a stimulus to the boy, who from the
first had ambitions far beyond anything that he was to achieve. Here was
his first lesson. The second came from Lady Fenn&mdash;a more vivid
impression for the child. Twenty years before Borrow was born Cowper had
sung her merits in his verse. She and her golden-headed cane are
commemorated in <i>Lavengro</i>. Dame Eleanor Fenn had made a reputation in
her time. As 'Mrs. Teachwell' and 'Mrs. Lovechild' she had published
books for the young of a most improving character, <i>The Child's
Grammar</i>, <i>The Mother's Grammar</i>, <i>A Short History of Insects</i>, and
<i>Cobwebs to Catch Flies</i> being of the number. The forty-fourth edition
of <i>The Child's Grammar</i> by Mrs. Lovechild appeared in 1851, and the
twenty-second edition of <i>The Mother's Grammar</i> in 1849. But it is her
husband that her name most recalls to us. Sir John Fenn gave us the
delightful Paston Letters&mdash;of which Horace Walpole said that 'they make
all other letters not worth reading.' Walpole described 'Mr. Fenn of
East Dereham in Norfolk' as 'a smatterer in antiquity, but a very good
sort of man.' Fenn, who held the original documents of the Letters, sent
his first two volumes, when published, to Buckingham Palace, and the
King acknowledged the gifts by knighting the editor, who, however, died
in 1794, before George Borrow was born. His widow survived until 1813,
and Borrow was in his seventh or eighth year when he caught these
notable glimpses of his 'Lady Bountiful,' who lived in 'the
half-aristocratic mansion' of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> town. But we know next to nothing of
Borrow in East Dereham, from which indeed he departed in his eighth
year. There are, however, interesting references to his memories of the
place in <i>Lavengro</i>. The first is where he recalls to his author friend,
who had offered him comet wine of 1811, his recollection of gazing at
the comet from the market-place of 'pretty D&mdash;&mdash;' in 1811.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The
second reference is when he goes to church with the gypsies and dreams
of an incident in his childhood:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew of the old
church of pretty Dereham. I had occasionally done so when a
child, and had suddenly woke up. Yes, surely, I had been asleep
and had woke up; but no! if I had been asleep I had been waking
in my sleep, struggling, striving, learning and unlearning in
my sleep. Years had rolled away whilst I had been asleep&mdash;ripe
fruit had fallen, green fruit had come on whilst I had been
asleep&mdash;how circumstances had altered, and above all myself
whilst I had been asleep. No, I had not been asleep in the old
church! I was in a pew, it is true, but not the pew of black
leather in which I sometimes fell asleep in days of yore, but
in a strange pew; and then my companions, they were no longer
those of days of yore. I was no longer with my respectable
father and mother, and my dear brother, but with the gypsy cral
and his wife, and the gigantic Tawno, the Antinous of the dusky
people. And what was I myself? No longer an innocent child but
a moody man, bearing in my face, as I knew well, the marks of
my strivings and strugglings; of what I had learnt and
unlearnt.</p></div>

<p>But Borrow, as I have said, left Dereham in his eighth year, and the
author of a <i>History of East Dereham</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> thus accounts for several
inaccuracies in his memory, both as to persons and things.</p>

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Norman Cross and Ambrose Smith.</span>&mdash;In <i>Lavengro</i> Borrow recalls
childish memories of Canterbury and of Hythe, at which latter place he
saw the church vault filled with ancient skulls as we may see it there
to-day. And after that the book which impressed itself most vividly upon
his memory was <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. How much he came to revere Defoe the
pages of <i>Lavengro</i> most eloquently reveal to us. 'Hail to thee, spirit
of Defoe! What does not my own poor self owe to thee?' In 1810-11 his
father was in the barracks at Norman Cross in Huntingdonshire. Here the
Government had bought a large tract of land, and built upon it a huge
wooden prison, and overlooking this a substantial barrack also of wood,
the only brick building on the land being the house of the Commandant.
The great building was destined for the soldiers taken prisoners in the
French wars. The place was constructed to hold 5000 prisoners, and 500
men were employed by the War Office in 1808 upon its construction. The
first batch of prisoners were the victims of the battle of Vimeiro in
that year. Borrow's description of the hardships of the prisoners has
been called in question by a later writer, Arthur Brown,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> who denies
the story of bad food and 'straw-plait hunts,' and charges Borrow with
recklessness of statement. 'What could have been the matter with the man
to write such stuff as this?' asks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> Brown in reference to Borrow's story
of bad meat and bad bread: which was not treating a great author with
quite sufficient reverence. Borrow was but recalling memories of
childhood, a period when one swallow does make a summer. He had
doubtless seen examples of what he described, although it may not have
been the normal condition of things. Brown's own description of the
Norman Cross prison was interwoven with a love romance, in which a
French officer fell in love with a girl of the neighbouring village of
Yaxley, and after Waterloo returned to England and married her. When he
wrote his story a very old man was still living at Yaxley, who
remembered, as a boy, having often seen the prisoners on the road, some
very well dressed, some in tatters, a few in uniform. The milestone is
still pointed out which marked the limit beyond which the
officer-prisoners might not walk. The buildings were destroyed in 1814,
when all the prisoners were sent home, and the house of the Commandant,
now a private residence, alone remains to recall this episode in our
history. But Borrow's most vivid memory of Norman Cross was connected
with the viper given to him by an old man, who had rendered it harmless
by removing the fangs. It was the possession of this tame viper that
enabled the child of eight&mdash;this was Borrow's age at the time&mdash;to
impress the gypsies that he met soon afterwards, and particularly the
boy Ambrose Smith, whom Borrow introduced to the world in <i>Lavengro</i> as
Jasper Petulengro. Borrow's frequent meetings with Petulengro<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> are no
doubt many of them mythical. He was an imaginative writer, and Dr.
Knapp's worst banality is to suggest that he 'invented nothing.' But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Petulengro was a very real person, who lived the usual roving gypsy
life. There is no reason to assume otherwise than that Borrow did
actually meet him at Norman Cross when he was eight years old, and
Ambrose a year younger, and not thirteen as Borrow states. In the
original manuscript of <i>Lavengro</i> in my possession, as in the copy of it
in Mrs. Borrow's handwriting that came into the possession of Dr. Knapp,
'Ambrose' is given instead of 'Jasper,' and the name was altered as an
afterthought. It is of course possible that Borrow did not actually meet
Jasper until his arrival in Norwich, for in the first half of the
nineteenth century various gypsy families were in the habit of
assembling their carts and staking their tents on the heights above
Norwich, known as Mousehold Heath, that glorious tract of country that
has been rendered memorable in history by the tragic life of Kett the
tanner, and has been immortalised in painting by Turner and Crome. Here
were assembled the Smiths and Hernes and Boswells, names familiar to
every student of gypsy lore. Jasper Petulengro, as Borrow calls him, or
Ambrose Smith, to give him his real name, was the son of F&#257;den Smith,
and his name of Ambrose was derived from his uncle, Ambrose Smith, who
was transported for stealing harness. Ambrose was twice married, and it
was his second wife, Sanspirella Herne, who comes into the Borrow story.
He had families by both his wives. Ambrose had an extraordinary varied
career. It will be remembered by readers of the <i>Zincali</i> that when he
visited Borrow at Oulton in 1842 he complained that 'There is no living
for the poor people, brother, the chokengres (police) pursue us from
place to place, and the gorgios are become either so poor or miserly
that they grudge our cattle a bite of grass by the wayside, and
ourselves a yard of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> ground to light a fire upon.' After a time Ambrose
left the eastern counties and crossed to Ireland. In 1868 he went to
Scotland, and there seems to have revived his fortunes. In 1878 he and
his family were encamped at Knockenhair Park, about a mile from Dunbar.
Here Queen Victoria, who was staying at Broxmouth Park near by with the
Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe, became interested in the gypsies, and paid
them a visit.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This was in the summer of 1878. Ambrose was then a
very old man. He died in the following October. His wife, Sanspi or
Sanspirella, received a message of sympathy from the Queen. Very shortly
after Ambrose's death, however, most of the family went off to America,
where doubtless they are now scattered, many of them, it may be, leading
successful lives, utterly oblivious of the association of one of their
ancestors with Borrow and his great book. Ambrose Smith was buried in
Dunbar cemetery, the Christian service being read over his grave, and
his friends erected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> a stone to him which bears the following
inscription, the hymn not being very accurately rendered:</p>

</div></div>

<p>In December 1912 a London newspaper contained an account of a gypsy
meeting at which Jasper Petulengro was present. Not only was this
obviously impossible, but no relative of Ambrose Smith is apparently
alive in England who could by any chance have justified the imposition.</p>

<p>I have said that it is probable that Borrow did not meet Jasper or
Ambrose until later days in Norwich. I assume this as possible because
Borrow misstates the age of his boy friend in <i>Lavengro</i>. Ambrose was
actually a year younger than Borrow, whereas when George was eight years
of age he represents Ambrose as 'a lad of some twelve or thirteen
years,' and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> keeps up this illusion on more than one later occasion.
However, we may take it as almost certain that Borrow received his first
impression of the gypsies in these early days at Norman Cross.</p>

<p>C. <span class="smcap">Edinburgh and David Haggart.</span>&mdash;Three years separated the sojourn of
the Borrow family at Norman Cross from their sojourn in Edinburgh&mdash;three
years of continuous wandering. The West Norfolk Militia were watching
the French prisoners at Norman Cross for fifteen months. After that we
have glimpses of them at Colchester, at East Dereham again, at Harwich,
at Leicester, at Huddersfield, concerning which place Borrow
incidentally in <i>Wild Wales</i> writes of having been at school, in
Sheffield, in Berwick-on-Tweed, and finally the family are in Edinburgh,
where they arrive on 6th April 1813. We have already referred to
Borrow's presence at the High School of Edinburgh, the school sanctified
by association with Walter Scott and so many of his illustrious
fellow-countrymen. He and his brother were at the High School for a
single session, that is, for the winter session of 1813-14, although
with the licence of a maker of fiction he claimed, in <i>Lavengro</i>, to
have been there for two years. But it is not in this brief period of
schooling of a boy of ten that we find the strongest influence that
Edinburgh gave to Borrow. Rather may we seek it in the acquaintanceship
with the once too notorious David Haggart. Seven years later than this
all the peoples of the three kingdoms were discussing David Haggart, the
Scots Jack Sheppard, the clever young prison-breaker, who was hanged at
Edinburgh in 1821 for killing his jailer in Dumfries prison. How much
David Haggart filled the imagination of every one who could read in the
early years of last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> century is demonstrated by a reference to the
Library Catalogue of the British Museum, where we find pamphlet after
pamphlet, broadsheet after broadsheet, treating of the adventures,
trial, and execution of this youthful jailbird. Even George Combe, the
phrenologist, most famous in his day, sat in judgment upon the young man
while he was in prison, and published a pamphlet which made a great
impression upon prison reformers. Combe submitted his observations to
Haggart in jail, and told the prisoner indeed that he had a greater
development of the organs of benevolence and justice than he had
anticipated. There cannot be a doubt but that Combe started in a
measure, through his treatment of this case, the theory that many of our
methods of punishment led to the making of habitual criminals.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But
by far the most valuable publication with regard to Haggart is one that
Borrow must have read in his youth. This was a life of Haggart written
by himself,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a little book that had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> wide circulation, and
containing a preface by George Robertson, Writer to the Signet, dated
Edinburgh, 20th July 1821. Mr. Robertson tells us that a portion of the
story was written by Haggart, and the remainder taken down from his
dictation. The profits of this book, Haggart arranged, were to go in
part to the school of the jail in which he was confined, and part to be
devoted to the welfare of his younger brothers and sister. From this
little biography we learn that Haggart was born in Golden Acre, near
Canon-Mills, in the county of Edinburgh in 1801, his father, John
Haggart, being a gamekeeper, and in later years a dog-trainer. The boy
was at school under Mr. Robin Gibson at Canon-Mills for two years. He
left school at ten years of age, and from that time until his execution
seems to have had a continuous career of thieving. He tells us that
before he was eleven years old he had stolen a bantam cock from a woman
belonging to the New Town of Edinburgh. He went with another boy to
Currie, six miles from Edinburgh, and there stole a pony, but this was
afterwards returned. When but twelve years of age he attended Leith
races, and it was here that he enlisted in the Norfolk Militia, then
stationed in Edinburgh Castle. This may very well have brought him into
contact with Borrow in the way described in <i>Lavengro</i>. He was only,
however, in the regiment for a year, for when it was sent back to
England the Colonel in command of it obtained young Haggart's discharge.
These dates coincide with Borrow's presence in Edinburgh. Haggart's
history for the next five or six years was in truth merely that of a
wandering pickpocket, sometimes in Scotland, sometimes in England, and
finally he became a notorious burglar. Incidentally he refers to a girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
with whom he was in love. Her name was Mary Hill She belonged to
Ecclefechan, which Haggart more than once visited. He must therefore
have known Carlyle, who had not then left his native village. In 1820 we
find him in Edinburgh, carrying on the same sort of depredations both
there and at Leith&mdash;now he steals a silk plaid, now a greatcoat, and now
a silver teapot. These thefts, of course, landed him in jail, out of
which he breaks rather dramatically, fleeing with a companion to Kelso.
He had, indeed, more than one experience of jail. Finally, we find him
in the prison of Dumfries destined to stand his trial for 'one act of
house-breaking, eleven cases of theft, and one of prison-breaking.'
While in prison at Dumfries he planned another escape, and in the
attempt to hit a jailer named Morrin on the head with a stone he
unexpectedly killed him. His escape from Dumfries jail after this
murder, and his later wanderings, are the most dramatic part of his
book. He fled through Carlisle to Newcastle, and then thought that he
would be safer if he returned to Scotland, where he found the rewards
that were offered for his arrest faced him wherever he went. He turned
up again in Edinburgh, where he seems to have gone about freely,
although reading everywhere the notices that a reward of seventy guineas
was offered for his apprehension. Then he fled to Ireland, where he
thought that his safety was assured. At Dromore he was arrested and
brought before the magistrate, but he spoke with an Irish brogue, and
declared that his name was John McColgan, and that he came from Armagh.
He escaped from Dromore jail by jumping through a window, and actually
went so far as to pay three pound ten shillings for his passage to
America, but he was afraid of the sea, and changed his mind, and lost
his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> passage money at the last moment. After this he made a tour right
through Ireland, in spite of the fact that the Dublin <i>Hue and Cry</i> had
a description of his person which he read more than once. His assurance
was such that in Tullamore he made a pig-driver apologise before the
magistrate for charging him with theft, although he had been living on
nothing else all the time he was in Ireland. Finally, he was captured,
being recognised by a policeman from Edinburgh. He was brought from
Ireland to Dumfries, landed in Calton jail, Edinburgh, and was tried and
executed. In addition to composing this biography Haggart wrote while in
Edinburgh jail a rather long set of verses, of which I give the
following two as specimens (the original autograph is in Lord Cockburn's
copy in the British Museum):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Able and willing, you all will find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though bound in chains, still free in mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Although of freedom I'm bereaved.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now for the crime that I'm condemn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same I never did intend,<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">D. Ireland and Murtagh.</span>&mdash;We may pass over the brief sojourn in Norwich
that was Borrow's lot in 1814, when the West Norfolk Militia left
Scotland. When Napoleon escaped from Elba the West Norfolk Regiment was
despatched to Ireland, and Captain Borrow again took his family with
him. We find the boy with his family at Clonmel from May to December of
1815. Here Borrow's elder brother, now a boy of fifteen, was promoted
from Ensign to Lieutenant, gaining in a year, as Dr. Knapp reminds us, a
position that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> had taken his father twelve years to attain. In
January 1816 the Borrows moved to Templemore, returning to England in
May of that year. Borrow, we see, was less than a year in Ireland, and
he was only thirteen years of age when he left the country. But it seems
to have been the greatest influence that guided his career. Three of the
most fascinating chapters in <i>Lavengro</i> were one outcome of that brief
sojourn, a thirst for the acquirement of languages was another, and
perhaps a taste for romancing a third. Borrow never came to have the
least sympathy with the Irish race, or its national aspirations. As the
son of a half-educated soldier he did not come in contact with any but
the vagabond element of Ireland, exactly as his father had done before
him.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Captain Borrow was asked on one occasion what language is being
spoken:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Irish,' said my father with a loud voice, 'and a bad language
it is.... There's one part of London where all the Irish
live&mdash;at least the worst of them&mdash;and there they hatch their
villainies to speak this tongue.'</p></div>

<p>And Borrow followed his father's prejudices throughout his life,
although in the one happy year in which he wrote <i>The Bible in Spain</i> he
was able to do justice to the country that had inspired so much of his
work:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Honour to Ireland and her 'hundred thousand welcomes'! Her
fields have long been the greenest in the world; her daughters
the fairest; her sons the bravest and most eloquent. May they
never cease to be so.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<p>In later years Orangemen were to him the only attractive element in the
life of Ireland, and we may be sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> that he was not displeased when his
stepdaughter married one of them. Yet the creator of literature works
more wisely than he knows, and Borrow's books have won the wise and
benign appreciation of many an Irish and Roman Catholic reader, whose
nationality and religion Borrow would have anathematised. Irishmen may
forgive Borrow much, because he was one of the first of modern English
writers to take their language seriously.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is true that he had but
the most superficial knowledge of it. He admits&mdash;in <i>Wild Wales</i>&mdash;that
he only knew it 'by ear.' The abundant Irish literature that has been so
diligently studied during the last quarter of a century was a closed
book to Borrow, whose few translations from the Irish have but little
value. Yet the very appreciation of Irish as a language to be seriously
studied in days before Dr. Sigerson, Dr. Douglas Hyde, and Dr. Kuno
Meyer had waxed enthusiastic and practical kindles our gratitude. Then
what a character is Murtagh. We are sure there was a Murtagh, although,
unlike Borrow's other boyish and vagabond friend Haggart, we know
nothing about him but what Borrow has to tell. Yet what a picture is
this where Murtagh wants a pack of cards:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I say, Murtagh!'</p>

<p>'Yes, Shorsha dear!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>'I have a pack of cards.'</p>

<p>'You don't say so, Shorsha ma vourneen?&mdash;you don't say that you
have cards fifty-two?'</p>

<p>'I do, though; and they are quite new&mdash;never been once used.'</p>

<p>'And you'll be lending them to me, I warrant?'</p>

<p>'Don't think it!&mdash;But I'll sell them to you, joy, if you like.'</p>

<p>'Hanam mon Dioul! am I not after telling you that I have no
money at all?'</p>

<p>'But you have as good as money, to me, at least; and I'll take
it in exchange.'</p>

<p>'What's that, Shorsha dear?'</p>

<p>'Irish!'</p>

<p>'Irish?'</p>

<p>'Yes, you speak Irish; I heard you talking it the other day to
the cripple. You shall teach me Irish.'</p>

<p>'And is it a language-master you'd be making of me?'</p>

<p>'To be sure!&mdash;what better can you do?&mdash;it would help you to
pass your time at school. You can't learn Greek, so you must
teach Irish!'</p>

<p>Before Christmas, Murtagh was playing at cards with his brother
Denis, and I could speak a considerable quantity of broken
Irish.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></div>

<p>With what distrust as we learn again and again in <i>Lavengro</i> did Captain
Borrow follow his son's inclination towards languages, and especially
the Irish language, in his early years, although seeing that he was well
grounded in Latin. Little did the worthy Captain dream that this, and
this alone, was to carry down his name through the ages:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ah, that Irish! How frequently do circumstances, at first sight
the most trivial and unimportant, exercise a mighty and
permanent influence on our habits and pursuits!&mdash;how frequently
is a stream turned aside from its natural course by some little
rock or knoll, causing it to make an abrupt turn! On a wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
road in Ireland I had heard Irish spoken for the first time;
and I was seized with a desire to learn Irish, the acquisition
of which, in my case, became the stepping-stone to other
languages. I had previously learnt Latin, or rather Lilly; but
neither Latin nor Lilly made me a philologist.</p></div>

<p>Borrow was never a philologist, but this first inclination was to lead
him to Spanish, to Welsh, and above all to Romany, and to make of him
the most beloved traveller and the strangest vagabond in all English
literature.</p>

<h3>GEORGE BORROW'S NORWICH&mdash;THE GURNEYS</h3>


<p>Norwich may claim to be one of the most fascinating cities in the
kingdom. To-day it is known to the wide world by its canaries and its
mustard, although its most important industry is the boot trade, in
which it employs some eight thousand persons. To the visitor it has many
attractions. The lovely cathedral with its fine Norman arches, the
Erpingham Gate so splendidly Gothic, the noble Castle Keep so imposingly
placed with the cattle-market below&mdash;these are all as Borrow saw them
nearly a century ago. So also is the church of St. Peter Mancroft, where
Sir Thomas Browne lies buried. And to the picturesque Mousehold Heath
you may still climb and recall one of the first struggles for liberty
and progress that past ages have seen, the Norfolk rising under Robert
Kett which has only not been glorified in song and in picture, because&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Treason doth never prosper&mdash;what's the reason?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why if it prosper none dare call it treason.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Kett's so-called rebellion was destined to failure, and its leader
to cruel martyrdom. Mousehold Heath has been made the subject of
paintings by Turner and Crome, and of fine word pictures by George
Borrow. When Borrow and his parents lighted upon Norwich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> in 1814 and
1816 the city had inspiring literary associations. Before the invention
of railways it seemed not uncommon for a fine intellectual life to
emanate from this or that cathedral city. Such an intellectual life was
associated with Lichfield when the Darwins and the Edgeworths gathered
at the Bishop's Palace around Dr. Seward and his accomplished daughters.
Norwich has more than once been such a centre. The first occasion was in
the period of which we write, when the Taylors and the Gurneys
flourished in a region of ideas; the second was during the years from
1837 to 1849, when Edward Stanley held the bishopric. This later period
does not come into our story, as by that time Borrow had all but left
Norwich. But of the earlier period, the period of Borrow's more or less
fitful residence in Norwich&mdash;1814 to 1833&mdash;we are tempted to write at
some length. There were three separate literary and social forces in
Norwich in the first decades of the nineteenth century&mdash;the Gurneys of
Earlham, the Taylor-Austin group, and William Taylor, who was in no way
related to Mrs. John Taylor and her daughter, Sarah Austin. The Gurneys
were truly a remarkable family, destined to leave their impress upon
Norwich and upon a wider world. At the time of his marriage in 1773 to
Catherine Bell, John Gurney, wool-stapler of Norwich, took his young
wife, whose face has been preserved in a canvas by Gainsborough, to live
in the old Court House in Magdalen Street, which had been the home of
two generations of the Gurney family. In 1786 John Gurney went with his
continually growing family to live at Earlham Hall, some two or three
miles out of Norwich on the Earlham Road. Here that family of eleven
children&mdash;one boy had died in infancy&mdash;grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> up. Not one but has an
interesting history, which is recorded by Mr. Augustus Hare and other
writers.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Elizabeth, the fourth daughter, married Joseph Fry, and as
Elizabeth Fry attained to a world-wide fame as a prison reformer. Hannah
married Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton of Slave Trade Abolition; Richenda, the
Rev. Francis Cunningham, who sent George Borrow upon his career; while
Louisa married Samuel Hoare of Hampstead. Of her Joseph John Gurney said
at her death in 1836 that she was 'superior in point of talent to any
other of my father's eleven children.' It is with the eleventh child,
however, that we have mainly to do, for this son, Joseph John Gurney,
alone appears in Borrow's pages. The picture of these eleven Quaker
children growing up to their various destinies under the roof of Earlham
Hall is an attractive one. Men and women of all creeds accepted the
catholic Quaker's hospitality. Mrs. Opie and a long list of worthies of
the past come before us, and when Mr. Gurney, in 1802, took his six
unmarried daughters to the Lakes Old Crome accompanied them as
drawing-master. There is, however, one picture in the story of
unforgettable charm, the episode of the courtship of Elizabeth Gurney by
Joseph Fry, and this I must quote from Mr. Augustus Hare's pleasant
book:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Fry had no intention of exposing himself to the possibility
of a refusal. He bought a very handsome gold watch and chain,
and laid it down upon a white seat&mdash;the white seat which still
exists&mdash;in the garden at Earlham. 'If Betsy takes up that
watch,' he said, 'it is a sign that she accepts me: if she does
not take it up by a particular hour, it will show that I must
leave Earlham.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The six sisters concealed themselves in six laurel-bushes in
different parts of the grounds to watch. One can imagine their
intense curiosity and anxiety. At last the tall, graceful
Betsy, her flaxen hair now hidden under a Quaker cap, shyly
emerged upon the gravel walk. She seemed scarcely conscious of
her surroundings, as if, 'on the wings of prayer, she was being
wafted into the unseen.' But she reached the garden seat, and
there, in the sunshine, lay the glittering new watch. The sight
of it recalled her to earth. She could not, could not, take it,
and fled swiftly back to the house. But the six sisters
remained in their laurel-bushes. They felt sure she would
revoke, and they did not watch in vain. An hour elapsed, in
which her father urged her, and in which conscience seemed to
drag her forwards. Once again did the anxious sisters see Betsy
emerge from the house, with more faltering steps this time, but
still inwardly praying, and slowly, tremblingly, they saw her
take up the watch, and the deed was done. She never afterwards
regretted it, though it was a bitter pang to her when she
collected her eighty-six children in the garden at Earlham and
bade them farewell, and though she wrote in her journal as a
bride, 'I cried heartily on leaving Norwich; the very stones in
the street were dear to me.'</p></div>

<p>In 1803&mdash;the year of Borrow's birth&mdash;John Gurney became a partner in the
great London Bank of Overend and Gurney, and his son, Joseph John, in
that same year went up to Oxford. In 1809 Joseph returned to take his
place in the bank, and to preside over the family of unmarried sisters
at Earlham, father and mother being dead, and many members of the family
distributed. Incidentally, we are told by Mr. Hare that the Gurneys of
Earlham at this time drove out with four black horses, and that when
Bishop Bathurst, Stanley's predecessor, required horses for State
occasions to drive him to the cathedral, he borrowed these, and the more
modest episcopal horses took the Quaker family to their meeting-house.
It does not come within the scope of this book, discursive as I choose
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> make it, to trace the fortunes of these eleven remarkable Gurney
children, or even of Borrow's momentary acquaintance, Joseph John
Gurney. His residence at Earlham, and his life of philanthropy, are a
romance in a way, although one wonders whether if the name of Gurney had
not been associated with so much of virtue and goodness the crash that
came long after Joseph John Gurney's death would have been quite so full
of affliction for a vast multitude. Joseph John Gurney died in 1847, in
his fifty-ninth year; his sister, Mrs. Fry, had died two years earlier.
The younger brother and twelfth child&mdash;Joseph John being the
eleventh&mdash;Daniel Gurney, the last of the twelve children, lived till
1880, aged eighty-nine. He had outlived by many years the catastrophe to
the great banking firm with which the name of Gurney is associated. This
great firm of Overend and Gurney, of which yet another brother, Samuel,
was the moving spirit, was organised nine years after his death&mdash;in
1865&mdash;into a joint-stock company, which failed to the amount of eleven
millions in 1866. At the time of the failure, which affected all
England, much as did the Liberator smash a generation later, the only
Gurney in the directorate was Daniel Gurney, to whom his sister, Lady
Buxton, allowed a pension of &pound;2000 a year. This is a long story to tell
by way of introduction to one episode in <i>Lavengro</i>. Dr. Knapp places
this episode in the year 1817, when Borrow was but fourteen years of age
and Gurney was twenty-nine. I need not apologise at this point for a
very lengthy quotation from a familiar book:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At some distance from the city, behind a range of hilly ground
which rises towards the south-west, is a small river, the
waters of which, after many meanderings, eventually enter the
principal river of the district, and assist to swell the tide
which it rolls down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> to the ocean. It is a sweet rivulet, and
pleasant it is to trace its course from its spring-head, high
up in the remote regions of Eastern Anglia, till it arrives in
the valley behind yon rising ground; and pleasant is that
valley, truly a good spot, but most lovely where yonder bridge
crosses the little stream. Beneath its arch the waters rush
garrulously into a blue pool, and are there stilled for a time,
for the pool is deep, and they appear to have sunk to sleep.
Farther on, however, you hear their voice again, where they
ripple gaily over yon gravelly shallow. On the left the hill
slopes gently down to the margin of the stream. On the right is
a green level, a smiling meadow, grass of the richest decks the
side of the slope; mighty trees also adorn it, giant elms, the
nearest of which, when the sun is nigh its meridian, fling a
broad shadow upon the face of the pool; through yon vista you
catch a glimpse of the ancient brick of an old English hall. It
has a stately look, that old building, indistinctly seen, as it
is, among those umbrageous trees; you might almost suppose it
an earl's home; and such it was, or rather upon its site stood
an earl's home, in days of old, for there some old Kemp, some
Sigurd, or Thorkild, roaming in quest of a hearthstead, settled
down in the grey old time, when Thor and Freya were yet gods,
and Odin was a portentous name. Yon old hall is still called
the Earl's Home, though the hearth of Sigurd is now no more,
and the bones of the old Kemp, and of Sigrith his dame, have
been mouldering for a thousand years in some neighbouring
knoll; perhaps yonder, where those tall Norwegian pines shoot
up so boldly into the air. It is said that the old earl's
galley was once moored where is now that blue pool, for the
waters of that valley were not always sweet; yon valley was
once an arm of the sea, a salt lagoon, to which the war-barks
of 'Sigurd, in search of a home,' found their way.</p>

<p>I was in the habit of spending many an hour on the banks of
that rivulet with my rod in my hand, and, when tired with
angling, would stretch myself on the grass, and gaze upon the
waters as they glided past, and not unfrequently, divesting
myself of my dress, I would plunge into the deep pool which I
have already mentioned, for I had long since learned to swim.
And it came to pass, that on one hot summer's day, after
bathing in the pool, I passed along the meadow till I came to a
shallow part, and, wading over to the opposite side, I adjusted
my dress, and commenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> fishing in another pool, beside which
was a small clump of hazels.</p>

<p>And there I sat upon the bank, at the bottom of the hill which
slopes down from 'the Earl's Home'; my float was on the waters,
and my back was towards the old hall. I drew up many fish,
small and great, which I took from off the hook mechanically,
and flung upon the bank, for I was almost unconscious of what I
was about, for my mind was not with my fish. I was thinking of
my earlier years&mdash;of the Scottish crags and the heaths of
Ireland&mdash;and sometimes my mind would dwell on my studies&mdash;on
the sonorous stanzas of Dante, rising and falling like the
waves of the sea&mdash;or would strive to remember a couplet or two
of poor Monsieur Boileau.</p>

<p>'Canst thou answer to thy conscience for pulling all those fish
out of the water and leaving them to gasp in the sun?' said a
voice, clear and sonorous as a bell.</p>

<p>I started, and looked round. Close behind me stood the tall
figure of a man, dressed in raiment of quaint and singular
fashion, but of goodly materials. He was in the prime and
vigour of manhood; his features handsome and noble, but full of
calmness and benevolence; at least I thought so, though they
were somewhat shaded by a hat of finest beaver, with broad
drooping eaves.</p>

<p>'Surely that is a very cruel diversion in which thou indulgest,
my young friend?' he continued.</p>

<p>'I am sorry for it, if it be, sir,' said I, rising; 'but I do
not think it cruel to fish.'</p>

<p>'What are thy reasons for thinking so?'</p>

<p>'Fishing is mentioned frequently in Scripture. Simon Peter was
a fisherman.'</p>

<p>'True; and Andrew his brother. But thou forgettest; they did
not follow fishing as a diversion, as I fear thou doest.&mdash;Thou
readest the Scriptures?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes?&mdash;not daily?&mdash;that is to be regretted. What
profession dost thou make?&mdash;I mean to what religious
denomination dost thou belong, my young friend?'</p>

<p>'Church.'</p>

<p>'It is a very good profession&mdash;there is much of Scripture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
contained in its liturgy. Dost thou read aught beside the
Scriptures?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes.'</p>

<p>'What dost thou read besides?'</p>

<p>'Greek, and Dante.'</p>

<p>'Indeed! then thou hast the advantage over myself; I can only
read the former. Well, I am rejoiced to find that thou hast
other pursuits beside thy fishing. Dost thou know Hebrew?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Thou shouldest study it. Why dost thou not undertake the
study?'</p>

<p>'I have no books.'</p>

<p>'I will lend thee books, if thou wish to undertake the study. I
live yonder at the hall, as perhaps thou knowest. I have a
library there, in which are many curious books, both in Greek
and Hebrew, which I will show to thee, whenever thou mayest
find it convenient to come and see me. Farewell! I am glad to
find that thou hast pursuits more satisfactory than thy cruel
fishing.'</p>

<p>And the man of peace departed, and left me on the bank of the
stream. Whether from the effect of his words or from want of
inclination to the sport, I know not, but from that day I
became less and less a practitioner of that 'cruel fishing.' I
rarely flung line and angle into the water, but I not
unfrequently wandered by the banks of the pleasant rivulet. It
seems singular to me, on reflection, that I never availed
myself of his kind invitation. I say singular, for the
extraordinary, under whatever form, had long had no slight
interest for me: and I had discernment enough to perceive that
yon was no common man. Yet I went not near him, certainly not
from bashfulness, or timidity, feelings to which I had long
been an entire stranger. Am I to regret this? perhaps, for I
might have learned both wisdom and righteousness from those
calm, quiet lips, and my after-course might have been widely
different. As it was, I fell in with other queer companions,
from whom I received widely different impressions than those I
might have derived from him. When many years had rolled on,
long after I had attained manhood, and had seen and suffered
much, and when our first interview had long been effaced from
the mind of the man of peace, I visited him in his venerable
hall, and partook of the hospitality of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> hearth. And there
I saw his gentle partner and his fair children, and on the
morrow he showed me the books of which he had spoken years
before by the side of the stream. In the low quiet chamber,
whose one window, shaded by a gigantic elm, looks down the
slope towards the pleasant stream, he took from the shelf his
learned books, Zohar and Mishna, Toldoth Jesu and Abarbenel.</p>

<p>'I am fond of these studies,' said he, 'which, perhaps, is not
to be wondered at, seeing that our people have been compared to
the Jews. In one respect I confess we are similar to them: we
are fond of getting money. I do not like this last author, this
Abarbenel, the worse for having been a money-changer. I am a
banker myself, as thou knowest.'</p>

<p>And would there were many like him, amidst the money-changers
of princes! The hall of many an earl lacks the bounty, the
palace of many a prelate the piety and learning, which adorn
the quiet Quaker's home!</p></div>

<p>It is doubtful if Borrow met Joseph John Gurney more than on the one
further occasion to which he refers above. At the commencement of his
engagement with the Bible Society he writes to its secretary, Mr. Jowett
(March 18, 1833), to say that he must procure from Mr. Cunningham 'a
letter of introduction from him to John Gurney,' and this second and
last interview must have taken place at Earlham before his departure for
Russia.</p>

<p>But if Borrow was to come very little under the influence of Joseph John
Gurney, his destiny was to be considerably moulded by the action of
Gurney's brother-in-law, Cunningham, who first put him in touch with the
Bible Society. Joseph John Gurney and his sisters were the very life of
the Bible Society in those years.</p>

<h3>GEORGE BORROW'S NORWICH&mdash;THE TAYLORS</h3>


<p>With the famous 'Taylors of Norwich' Borrow seems to have had no
acquaintance, although he went to school with a connection of that
family, James Martineau. These socially important Taylors were in no way
related to William Taylor of that city, who knew German literature, and
scandalised the more virtuous citizens by that, and perhaps more by his
fondness for wine and also for good English beer&mdash;a drink over which his
friend Borrow was to become lyrical. When people speak of the Norwich
Taylors they refer to the family of Dr. John Taylor, who in 1783 was
elected to the charge of the Presbyterian congregation in Norwich. His
eldest son, Richard, married Margaret, the daughter of a mayor of
Norwich of the name of Meadows; and Sarah, another daughter of that same
worshipful mayor, married David Martineau, grandson of Gaston Martineau,
who fled from France at the time of the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Harriet and James Martineau were grandchildren of this
David. The second son of Richard and Margaret Taylor was John, who
married Susannah Cook. Susannah is the clever Mrs. John Taylor of this
story, and her daughter of even greater ability was Sarah Austin, the
wife of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> famous jurist. Their daughter married Sir Alexander
Duff-Gordon. She was the author of <i>Letters from Egypt</i>, a book to which
George Meredith wrote an 'Introduction,' so much did he love the writer.
Lady Duff-Gordon's daughter, Janet Ross, wrote the biography of her
mother, her grandmother, and Mrs. John Taylor, in <i>Three Generations of
Englishwomen</i>. A niece, Lena Duff-Gordon (Mrs. Waterfield), has written
pleasant books of travel, and so, for five generations, this family has
produced clever women-folk. But here we are only concerned with Mrs.
John Taylor, called by her friends the 'Madame Roland of Norwich.' Lucy
Aikin describes how she 'darned her boy's grey worsted stockings while
holding her own with Southey, Brougham, or Mackintosh.' One of her
daughters married Henry Reeve, and, as I have said, another married John
Austin. Borrow was twenty years of age and living in Norwich when Mrs.
Taylor died. It is to be regretted that in the early impressionable
years his position as a lawyer's clerk did not allow of his coming into
a circle in which he might have gained certain qualities of <i>savoir
faire</i> and <i>joie de vivre</i>, which he was all his days to lack. Of the
Taylor family the Duke of Sussex said that they reversed the ordinary
saying that it takes nine tailors to make a man. The witticism has been
attributed to Sydney Smith, but Mrs. Ross gives evidence that it was the
Duke's&mdash;the youngest son of George III. In his <i>Life of Sir James
Mackintosh</i> Basil Montagu, referring to Mrs. John Taylor, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Norwich was always a haven of rest to us, from the literary
society with which that city abounded. Dr. Sayers we used to
visit, and the high-minded and intelligent William Taylor; but
our chief delight was in the society of Mrs. John Taylor, a
most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> intelligent and excellent woman, mild and unassuming,
quiet and meek, sitting amidst her large family, occupied with
her needle and domestic occupations, but always assisting, by
her great knowledge, the advancement of kind and dignified
sentiment and conduct.</p></div>

<p>We note here the reference to 'the high-minded and intelligent William
Taylor,' because William Taylor, whose influence upon Borrow's destiny
was so pronounced, has been revealed to many by the slanders of Harriet
Martineau, that extraordinary compound of meanness and generosity, of
poverty-stricken intelligence and rich endowment. In her
<i>Autobiography</i>, published in 1877, thirty-four years after Robberds's
<i>Memoir of William Taylor</i>, she dwells upon the drinking propensities of
William Taylor, who was a schoolfellow of her father's. She admits,
indeed, that Taylor was an ideal son, whose 'exemplary filial duty was a
fine spectacle to the whole city,' and she continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His virtues as a son were before our eyes when we witnessed his
endurance of his father's brutality of temper and manners, and
his watchfulness in ministering to the old man's comfort in his
infirmities. When we saw, on a Sunday morning, William Taylor
guiding his blind mother to chapel ... we could forgive
anything that had shocked or disgusted us at the dinner-table.</p></div>

<p>Well, Harriet Martineau is not much to be trusted as to Taylor's virtues
or his vices, for her early recollections are frequently far from the
mark. Thus she refers under the date 1833 to the fact that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The great days of the Gurneys were not come yet. The remarkable
family from which issued Mrs. Fry and Joseph John Gurney were
then a set of dashing young people, dressed in gay riding
habits and scarlet boots, and riding about the country to balls
and gaieties of all sorts.</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact, in this year, 1833, Mrs. Fry was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> the mother of
fifteen children, and had nine grandchildren, and Joseph John Gurney had
been twice a widower. Both brother and sister were zealous
philanthropists at this date. And so we may take with some measure of
qualification Harriet Martineau's many strictures upon Taylor's drinking
habits, which were, no doubt, those of his century and epoch; although
perhaps beyond the acceptable standard of Norwich, where the Gurneys
were strong teetotallers, and the Bishop once invited Father Mathew,
then in the glory of his temperance crusade, to discourse in his
diocese. Indeed, Robberds, his biographer, tells us explicitly that
these charges of intemperance were 'grossly and unjustly exaggerated.'
William Taylor's life is pleasantly interlinked with Scott and Southey.
Lucy Aikin records that she heard Sir Walter Scott declare to Mrs.
Barbauld that Taylor had laid the foundations of his literary
career&mdash;had started him upon the path of glory through romantic verse to
romantic prose, from <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> to <i>Waverley</i>. It
was the reading of Taylor's translation of B&uuml;rger's <i>Lenore</i> that did
all this. 'This, madam,' said Scott, 'was what made me a poet. I had
several times attempted the more regular kinds of poetry without
success, but here was something that I thought I could do.' Southey
assuredly loved Taylor, and each threw at the feet of the other the
abundant literary learning that both possessed. This we find in a
correspondence which, reading more than a century after it was written,
still has its charm.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The son of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> wealthy manufacturer of Norwich,
Taylor was born in that city in 1765. He was in early years a pupil of
Mrs. Barbauld. At fourteen he was placed in his father's counting-house,
and soon afterwards was sent abroad, in the company of one of the
partners, to acquire languages. He learnt German thoroughly at a time
when few Englishmen had acquaintance with its literature. To Goethe's
genius he never did justice, having been offended by that great man's
failure to acknowledge a book that Taylor sent to him, exactly as
Carlyle and Borrow alike were afterwards offended by similar
delinquencies on the part of Walter Scott. When he settled again in
Norwich he commenced to write for the magazines, among others for Sir
Richard Phillips's <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, and to correspond with Southey.
At the time Southey was a poor man, thinking of abandoning literature
for the law, and hopeful of practising in Calcutta. The Norwich
Liberals, however, aspired to a newspaper to be called <i>The Iris</i>.
Taylor asked Southey to come to Norwich and to become its editor.
Southey declined and Taylor took up the task. The <i>Norwich Iris</i> lasted
for two years. Southey never threw over his friendship for Taylor,
although their views ultimately came to be far apart. Writing to Taylor
in 1803 he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your theology does nothing but mischief; it serves only to thin
the miserable ranks of Unitarianism. The regular troops of
infidelity do little harm; and their trumpeters, such as
Voltaire and Paine, not much more. But it is such pioneers as
Middleton, and you and your German friends, that work
underground and sap the very citadel. That <i>Monthly Magazine</i>
is read by all the Dissenters&mdash;I call it the Dissenters'
Obituary&mdash;and here are you eternally mining, mining, under the
shallow faith of their half-learned, half-witted, half-paid,
half-starved pastors.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>But the correspondence went on apace, indeed it occupies the larger part
of Robberds's two substantial volumes. It is in the very last letter
from Taylor to Southey that we find an oft-quoted reference to Borrow.
The letter is dated 12th March 1821:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Norwich young man is construing with me Schiller's <i>Wilhelm
Tell</i> with the view of translating it for the Press. His name
is George Henry Borrow, and he has learnt German with
extraordinary rapidity; indeed, he has the gift of tongues,
and, though not yet eighteen, understands twelve
languages&mdash;English, Welsh, Erse, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German,
Danish, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese; he would like
to get into the Office for Foreign Affairs, but does not know
how.</p></div>

<p>Although this was the last letter to Southey that is published in the
memoir, Taylor visited Southey at Keswick in 1826. Taylor's three
volumes of the <i>Historic Survey of German Poetry</i> appeared in 1828,
1829, and 1830. Sir Walter Scott, in the last year of his life, wrote
from Abbotsford on 23rd April 1832 to Taylor to protest against an
allusion to 'William Scott of Edinburgh' being the author of a
translation of <i>Goetz von Berlichingen</i>. Scott explained that he (Walter
Scott) was that author, and also made allusion to the fact that he had
borrowed with acknowledgment two lines from Taylor's <i>Lenore</i> for his
own&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tramp, tramp along the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splash, splash across the sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>adding that his recollection of the obligation was infinitely stronger
than of the mistake. It would seem, however, that the name 'William' was
actually on the title-page of the London edition of 1799 of <i>Goetz von
Berlichingen</i>. When Southey heard of the death of Taylor in 1836 he
wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was not aware of my old friend's illness, or I should
certainly have written to him, to express that unabated regard
which I have felt for him eight-and-thirty years, and that hope
which I shall ever feel, that we may meet in the higher state
of existence. I have known very few who equalled him in
talents&mdash;none who had a kinder heart; and there never lived a
more dutiful son, or a sincerer friend.</p></div>

<p>Taylor's many books are now all forgotten. His translation of B&uuml;rger's
<i>Lenore</i> one now only recalls by its effect upon Scott; his translation
of Lessing's <i>Nathan the Wise</i> has been superseded. His voluminous
<i>Historic Survey of German Poetry</i> only lives through Carlyle's severe
review in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> against the many strictures in
which Taylor's biographer attempts to defend him. Taylor had none of
Carlyle's inspiration. Not a line of his work survives in print in our
day, but it was no small thing to have been the friend and correspondent
of Southey, whose figure in literary history looms larger now than it
did when Emerson asked contemptuously, 'Who's Southey?'; and to have
been the wise mentor of George Borrow is in itself to be no small thing
in the record of letters. There is a considerable correspondence between
Taylor and Sir Richard Phillips in Robberds's <i>Memoir</i>, and Phillips
seemed always anxious to secure articles from Taylor for the <i>Monthly</i>,
and even books for his publishing-house. Hence the introduction from
Taylor that Borrow carried to London might have been most effective if
Phillips had had any use for poor and impracticable would-be authors.</p>

<h3>GEORGE BORROW'S NORWICH&mdash;THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL</h3>


<p>When George Borrow first entered Norwich after the long journey from
Edinburgh, Joseph John Gurney, born 1788, was twenty-six years of age,
and William Taylor, born 1765, was forty-nine. Borrow was eleven years
of age. Captain Borrow took temporary lodgings at the Crown and Angel
Inn in St. Stephen's Street, George was sent to the Grammar School, and
his elder brother started to learn drawing and painting with John Crome
('Old Crome') of many a fine landscape. But the wanderings of the family
were not yet over. Napoleon escaped from Elba, and the West Norfolk
Militia were again put on the march. This time it was Ireland to which
they were destined, and we have already shadowed forth, with the help of
<i>Lavengro</i>, that momentous episode. The victory of Waterloo gave Europe
peace, and in 1816 the Borrow family returned to Norwich, there to pass
many quiet years. In 1819 Captain Borrow was pensioned&mdash;eight shillings
a day. From 1816 till his father's death in 1824 Borrow lived in Norwich
with his family. Their home was in King's Court, Willow Lane, a modest
one-storey house in a <i>cul de sac</i>, which we have already described. In
King's Court, Willow Lane, Borrow lived at intervals until his marriage
in 1840, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> mother continued to live in the house until, in 1849,
she agreed to join her son and daughter-in-law at Oulton. Yet the house
comes little into the story of Borrow's life, as do the early houses of
many great men of letters, nor do subsequent houses come into his story;
the house at Oulton and the house at Hereford Square are equally barren
of association; the broad highway and the windy heath were Borrow's
natural home. He was never a 'civilised' being; he never shone in
drawing-rooms. Let us, however, return to Borrow's schooldays, of which
the records are all too scanty, and not in the least invigorating. The
Norwich Grammar School has an interesting tradition. We pass to the
cathedral through the beautiful Erpingham Gate built about 1420 by Sir
Thomas Erpingham, and we find the school on the left. It was originally
a chapel, and the porch is at least five hundred years old. The
schoolroom is sufficiently old-world-looking for us to imagine the
schoolboys of past generations sitting at the various desks. The school
was founded in 1547, but the registers have been lost, and so we know
little of its famous pupils of earlier days. Lord Nelson and Rajah
Brooke are the two names of men of action that stand out most honourably
in modern times among the scholars<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. In literature Borrow had but one
schoolfellow, who afterwards came to distinction&mdash;James Martineau.
Borrow's headmaster was the Reverend Edward Valpy, who held the office
from 1810 to 1829, and to whom is credited the destruction of the
school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> archives. Borrow's two years of the Grammar School were not
happy ones. Borrow, as we have shown, was not of the stuff of which
happy schoolboys are made. He had been a wanderer&mdash;Scotland, Ireland,
and many parts of England had assisted in a fragmentary education; he
was now thirteen years of age, and already a vagabond at heart. But let
us hear Dr. Augustus Jessopp, who was headmaster of the same Grammar
School from 1859 to 1879. Writing of a meeting of old Norvicensians to
greet the Rajah, Sir James Brooke, in 1858, when there was a great
'whip' of the 'old boys,' Dr. Jessopp tells us that Borrow, then living
at Yarmouth, did not put in an appearance among his schoolfellows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My belief is that he never was popular among them, that he
never attained a high place in the school, and he was a 'free
boy.' In those days there were a certain number of day boys at
Norwich school, who were nominated by members of the
Corporation, and who paid no tuition fees; they had to submit
to a certain amount of snubbing at the hands of the boarders,
who for the most part were the sons of the county gentry. Of
course, such a proud boy as George Borrow would resent this,
and it seems to have rankled with him all through his life....
To talk of Borrow as a 'scholar' is absurd. 'A picker-up of
learning's crumbs' he was, but he was absolutely without any of
the training or the instincts of a scholar. He had had little
education till he came to Norwich, and was at the Grammar
School little more than two years. It is pretty certain that he
knew no Greek when he entered there, and he never seems to have
acquired more than the elements of that language.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet the only real influence that Borrow carried away from the Grammar
School was concerned with foreign languages. He did take to the French
master and exiled priest, Thomas d'Eterville, a native of Caen, who had
emigrated to Norwich in 1793. D'Eterville taught French, Italian, and
apparently, to Borrow, a little Spanish; and Borrow, with his wonderful
memory, must have been his favourite pupil. In his edition of <i>Lavengro</i>
Dr. Knapp publishes a brief dialogue between master and pupil, which
gives us an amusing glimpse of the worthy d'Eterville, whom the boys
called 'poor old Detterville.' In the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters
of <i>Lavengro</i> he is pleasantly described by his pupil, who adds, with
characteristic 'bluff,' that d'Eterville said 'on our arrival at the
conclusion of Dante's <i>Hell</i>, "vous serez un jour un grand philologue,
mon cher."'</p>

<p>Borrow's biographers have dwelt at length upon one episode of his
schooldays&mdash;the flogging he received from Valpy for playing truant with
three other boys. One, by name John Dalrymple, faltered on the way, the
two faithful followers of George in his escapade being two brothers
named Theodosius and Francis Purland, whose father kept a chemist's shop
in Norwich. The three boys wandered away as far as Acle, eleven miles
from Norwich, whence they were ignomimously brought back and birched.
John Dalrymple's brother Arthur, son of a distinguished Norwich surgeon,
who became Clerk of the Peace at Norwich in 1854, and died in 1868, has
left a memorandum concerning Borrow, from which I take the following
extract<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I was at school with Borrow at the Free School, Norwich, under
the Rev. E. Valpy. He was an odd, wild boy, and always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> wanting
to turn Robinson Crusoe or Buccaneer. My brother John was about
Borrow's age, and on one occasion Borrow, John, and another,
whose name I forget, determined to run away and turn pirates.
John carried an old horse pistol and some potatoes as his
contribution to the general stock, but his zeal was soon
exhausted, he turned back at Thorpe Lunatic Asylum; but Borrow
went off to Yarmouth, and lived on the Caister Denes for a few
days. I don't remember hearing of any exploits. He had a
wonderful facility for learning languages, which, however, he
never appears to have turned to account.</p></div>

<p>James Martineau, afterwards a popular preacher and a distinguished
theologian of the Unitarian creed, here comes into the story. He was a
contemporary with Borrow at the Norwich Grammar School as already
stated, but the two boys had little in common. There was nothing of the
vagabond about James Martineau, and concerning Borrow&mdash;if on no other
subject&mdash;he would probably have agreed with his sister Harriet, whose
views we shall quote in a later chapter. In Martineau's <i>Memoirs</i>,
voluminous and dull, there is only one reference to Borrow;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but a
correspondent once ventured to approach the eminent divine concerning
the rumour as to Martineau's part in the birching of the author of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, and received the following letter:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">35 <span class="smcap">Gordon Square, London, W.C.</span>, <i>December 6, 1895.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Two or three years ago Mr. Egmont Hake (author, I
think, of a life of Gordon) sought an interview with me, as
reputed to be Borrow's sole surviving schoolfellow, in order to
gather information or test traditions about his schooldays.
This was with a view to a memoir which he was compiling, he
said, out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> literary remains which had been committed to
him by his executors. I communicated to him such recollections
as I could clearly depend upon and leave at his disposal for
publication or for suppression as he might think fit. Under
these circumstances I feel that they are rightfully his, and
that I am restrained from placing them at disposal elsewhere
unless and until he renounces his claim upon them. But though I
cannot repeat them at length for public use, I am not precluded
from correcting inaccuracies in stories already in circulation,
and may therefore say that Mr. Arthur Dalrymple's version of
the Yarmouth escapade is wrong in making his brother John a
partner in the transaction. John had quite too much sense for
that; the only victims of Borrow's romance were two or three
silly boys&mdash;mere lackeys of Borrow's commanding will&mdash;who
helped him to make up a kit for the common knapsack by
pilferings out of their fathers' shops.</p>

<p>The Norwich gentleman who fell in with the boys lying in the
hedgerow near the half-way inn knew one of them, and wormed out
of him the drift of their enterprise, and engaging a postchaise
packed them all into it, and in his gig saw them safe home.</p>

<p>It is true that I had to <i>hoist</i> (not 'horse') Borrow for his
flogging, but not that there was anything exceptional or
capable of leaving permanent scars in the infliction. Mr. Valpy
was not given to excess of that kind.</p>

<p>I have never read <i>Lavengro</i>, and cannot give any opinion about
the correct spelling of the 'Exul sacerdos' name.</p>

<p>Borrow's romance and William Taylor's love of paradox would
doubtless often run together, like a pair of well-matched
steeds, and carry them away in the same direction. But there
was a strong&mdash;almost wild&mdash;<i>religious</i> sentiment in Borrow, of
which only faint traces appear in W. T. In Borrow it had always
a tendency to pass from a sympathetic to an antipathetic form.
He used to gather about him three or four favourite
schoolfellows, after they had learned their class lesson and
before the class was called up, and with a sheet of paper and
book on his knee, invent and tell a story, making rapid little
pictures of each <i>dramatis persona</i> that came upon the stage.
The plot was woven and spread out with much ingenuity, and the
characters were various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> and well discriminated. But two of
them were sure to turn up in every tale, the Devil and the
Pope, and the working of the drama invariably had the same
issue&mdash;the utter ruin and disgrace of these two potentates. I
had often thought that there was a presage here of the mission
which produced <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.&mdash;I am, dear sir, very
truly yours,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">James Martineau.</span><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Yet it is amusing to trace the story through various phases. Dr.
Martineau's letter was the outcome of his attention being called to a
statement made in a letter written by a lady in Hampstead to a friend in
Norwich, which runs as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>11th Nov. 1893.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Martineau, to amuse some boys at a school treat, told us
about George Borrow, his schoolfellow: he was always reading
adventures of smugglers and pirates, etc., and at last, to
carry out his ideas, got a set of his schoolfellows to promise
to join him in an expedition to Yarmouth, where he had heard of
a ship that he thought would take them. The boys saved all the
food they could from their meals, and what money they had, and
one morning started very early to walk to Yarmouth. They got
half-way&mdash;to Blofield, I think&mdash;when they were so tired they
had to rest by the roadside, and eat their lunch. While they
were resting, a gentleman, whose son was at the Free School,
passed in his gig. He thought it was very odd so many boys,
some of whom he had seen, should be waiting about, so he drove
back and asked them if they would come to dine with him at the
inn. Of course they were only too glad, poor boys: but as soon
as he had got them all in he sent his servant with a letter to
Mr. Valpy, who sent a coach and brought them all back. You know
what a cruel man that Dr. V. was. He made Dr. Martineau take
poor Borrow on his back, 'horse him,' I think he called it, and
flogged him so that Dr. M. said he would carry the marks for
the rest of his life, and he had to keep his bed for a
fortnight. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> boys got off with lighter punishment, but
Borrow was the ring-leader. Those were the 'good old times'! I
have heard Dr. M. say that not for another life would he go
through the misery he suffered as 'town boy' at that school.</p></div>

<p>Miss Frances Power Cobbe, who lived next door to Borrow in Hereford
Square, Brompton, in the 'sixties, as we shall see later, has a word to
say on the point:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. Martineau once told me that he and Borrow had been
schoolfellows at Norwich some sixty years before. Borrow had
persuaded several of his other companions to rob their fathers'
tills, and then the party set forth to join some smugglers on
the coast. By degrees the truants all fell out of line and were
picked up, tired and hungry, along the road, and brought back
to Norwich School, where condign chastisement awaited them.
George Borrow, it seems, received his large share <i>horsed</i> on
James Martineau's back! The early connection between the two
old men, as I knew them, was irresistibly comic to my mind.
Somehow when I asked Mr. Borrow once to come and meet some
friends at our house he accepted our invitation as usual, but,
on finding that Dr. Martineau was to be of the party, hastily
withdrew his acceptance on a transparent excuse; nor did he
ever after attend our little assemblies without first
ascertaining that Dr. Martineau was not to be present.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></div>

<p>James Martineau died in 1900, but the last of Borrow's schoolfellows to
die was, I think, Mr. William Edmund Image, a Justice of the Peace and
Deputy Lieutenant for Suffolk. He resided at Herringswell House, near
Mildenhall, where he died in 1903, aged 96 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Valpy of the Norwich Grammar School is scarcely to be blamed that he
was not able to make separate rules for a quite abnormal boy. Yet, if
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> could have known, Borrow was better employed playing truant and
living up to his life-work as a glorified vagabond than in studying in
the ordinary school routine. George Borrow belonged to a type of
boy&mdash;there are many such&mdash;who learn much more out of school than in its
bounds; and the boy Borrow, picking up brother vagabonds in Tombland
Fair, and already beginning, in his own peculiar way, his language
craze, was laying the foundations that made <i>Lavengro</i> possible.</p>

<h3>GEORGE BORROW'S NORWICH&mdash;THE LAWYER'S OFFICE</h3>


<p>Doubts were very frequently expressed in Borrow's lifetime as to his
having really been articled to a solicitor, but the indefatigable Dr.
Knapp set that point at rest by reference to the Record Office. Borrow
was articled to Simpson and Rackham of Tuck's Court, St. Giles's,
Norwich, 'for the term of five years'&mdash;from March 1819 to March
1824&mdash;and these five years were spent in and about Norwich, and were
full of adventure of a kind with which the law had nothing to do. If
Borrow had had the makings of a lawyer he could not have entered the
profession under happier auspices. The firm was an old established one
even in his day. It had been established in Tuck's Court as Simpson and
Rackham, then it became Rackham and Morse, Rackham, Cooke and Rackham,
and Rackham and Cooke; finally, Tom Rackham, a famous Norwich man in his
day, moved to another office, and the firm of lawyers who occupy the
original offices in our day is called Leathes Prior and Sons. Borrow has
told us frankly what a poor lawyer's clerk he made&mdash;he was always
thinking of things remote from that profession, of gypsies, of
prize-fighters, and of word-makers. Yet he loved the head of the firm,
William Simpson, who must have been a kind and tolerant guide to the
curious youth. Simpson was for a time Town Clerk of Norwich,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> and his
portrait hangs in the Blackfriars Hall. Borrow went to live with Mr.
Simpson in the Upper Close near the Grammar School. Archdeacon Groome
recalled having seen Borrow 'reserved and solitary' haunting the
precincts of the playground; another schoolboy, William Drake,
remembered him as 'tall, spare, dark-complexioned.'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Here is Borrow's
account of his master and of his work:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A more respectable-looking individual was never seen; he really
looked what he was, a gentleman of the law&mdash;there was nothing
of the pettifogger about him: somewhat under the middle size,
and somewhat rotund in person, he was always dressed in a full
suit of black, never worn long enough to become threadbare. His
face was rubicund, and not without keenness; but the most
remarkable thing about him was the crown of his head, which was
bald, and shone like polished ivory, nothing more white,
smooth, and lustrous. Some people have said that he wore false
calves, probably because his black silk stockings never
exhibited a wrinkle; they might just as well have said that he
waddled, because his boots creaked; for these last, which were
always without a speck, and polished as his crown, though of a
different hue, did creak, as he walked rather slowly. I cannot
say that I ever saw him walk fast.</p>

<p>He had a handsome practice, and might have died a very rich
man, much richer than he did, had he not been in the habit of
giving rather expensive dinners to certain great people, who
gave him nothing in return, except their company; I could never
discover his reasons for doing so, as he always appeared to me
a remarkably quiet man, by nature averse to noise and bustle;
but in all dispositions there are anomalies. I have already
said that he lived in a handsome house, and I may as well here
add that he had a very handsome wife, who both dressed and
talked exceedingly well.</p>

<p>So I sat behind the deal desk, engaged in copying documents of
various kinds; and in the apartment in which I sat, and in the
adjoining ones, there were others, some of whom likewise copied
documents, while some were engaged in the yet more difficult
task of drawing them up; and some of these, sons of nobody,
were paid for the work they did, whilst others, like myself,
sons of somebody, paid for being permitted to work, which, as
our principal observed, was but reasonable, forasmuch as we not
unfrequently utterly spoiled the greater part of the work
intrusted to our hands.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></div>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>And he goes on to tell us that he studied the Welsh language and later
the Danish; his master said that his inattention would assuredly make
him a bankrupt, and his father sighed over his eccentric and
impracticable son. The passion for languages had indeed caught hold of
Borrow. Among my Borrow papers I find a memorandum in the handwriting of
his stepdaughter in which she says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have often heard his mother say, that when a mere child of
eight or nine years, all his pocket-money was spent in
purchasing foreign Dictionaries and Grammars; he formed an
acquaintance with an old woman who kept a bookstall in the
market-place of Norwich, whose son went voyages to Holland with
cattle, and brought home Dutch books, which were eagerly bought
by little George. One day the old woman was crying, and told
him that her son was in prison. 'For doing what?' asked the
child. 'For taking a silk handkerchief out of a gentleman's
pocket.' 'Then,' said the boy, 'your son stole the pocket
handkerchief?' 'No dear, no, my son did not steal,&mdash;he only
glyfaked.'</p></div>

<p>We have no difficulty in recognising here the heroine of the Moll
Flanders episode in <i>Lavengro</i>. But it was not from casual meetings with
Welsh grooms and Danes and Dutchmen that Borrow acquired even such
command of various languages as was undoubtedly his. We have it on the
authority of an old fellow-pupil at the Grammar School, Burcham,
afterwards a London police-magistrate, that William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> Taylor gave him
lessons in German,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but he acquired most of his varied knowledge in
these impressionable years in the Corporation Library of Norwich. Dr.
Knapp found, in his most laudable examination of some of the books,
Borrow's neat pencil notes, the making of which was not laudable on the
part of his hero. One book here marked was on ancient Danish literature,
the author of which, Olaus Wormius, gave him the hint for calling
himself Olaus Borrow for a time&mdash;a signature that we find in some of
Borrow's published translations. Borrow at this time had aspirations of
a literary kind, and Thomas Campbell accepted a translation of
Schiller's <i>Diver</i>, which was signed 'O. B.' There were also
translations from the German, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish, in the
<i>Monthly Magazine</i>. Clearly Borrow was becoming a formidable linguist,
if not a very exact master of words. Still he remained a vagabond, and
loved to wander over Mousehold Heath, to the gypsy encampment, and to
make friends with the Romany folk; he loved also to haunt the horse
fairs for which Norwich was so celebrated; and he was not averse from
the companionship of wilder spirits who loved pugilism, if we may trust
<i>Lavengro</i>, and if we may assume, as we justly may, that he many times
cast youthful, sympathetic eyes on John Thurtell in these years, the
to-be murderer of Weare, then actually living with his father in a house
on the Ipswich Road, Thurtell, the father, being in no mean position in
the city&mdash;an alderman, and a sheriff in 1815. Yes, there was plenty to
do and to see in Norwich, and Borrow's memories of it were nearly always
kindly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A fine old city, truly, is that, view it from whatever side you
will; but it shows best from the east, where ground, bold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
elevated, overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it
stands. Gazing from those heights, the eye beholds a scene
which cannot fail to awaken, even in the least sensitive bosom,
feelings of pleasure and admiration. At the foot of the heights
flows a narrow and deep river, with an antique bridge
communicating with a long and narrow suburb, flanked on either
side by rich meadows of the brightest green, beyond which
spreads the city; the fine old city, perhaps the most curious
specimen at present extant of the genuine old English town.
Yes, there it spreads from north to south, with its venerable
houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its
mighty mound, which, if tradition speaks true, was raised by
human hands to serve as the grave-heap of an old heathen king,
who sits deep within it, with his sword in his hand, and his
gold and silver treasures about him. There is a grey old castle
upon the top of that mighty mound; and yonder, rising three
hundred feet above the soil, from among those noble forest
trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-encircled
cathedral spire, around which a garrulous army of rooks and
choughs continually wheel their flight. Now, who can wonder
that the children of that fine old city are proud of her, and
offer up prayers for her prosperity? I myself, who was not born
within her walls, offer up prayers for her prosperity, that
want may never visit her cottages, vice her palaces, and that
the abomination of idolatry may never pollute her temples.</p></div>

<p>But at the very centre of Borrow's Norwich life was William Taylor,
concerning whom we have already written much. It was a Jew named Mousha,
a quack it appears, who pretended to know German and Hebrew, and had but
a smattering of either language, who first introduced Borrow to Taylor,
and there is a fine dialogue between the two in <i>Lavengro</i>, of which
this is the closing fragment:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Are you happy?' said the young man.</p>

<p>'Why, no! And, between ourselves, it is that which induces me
to doubt sometimes the truth of my opinions. My life, upon the
whole, I consider a failure; on which account, I would not
counsel you, or anyone, to follow my example too closely. It
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> getting late, and you had better be going, especially as
your father, you say, is anxious about you. But, as we may
never meet again, I think there are three things which I may
safely venture to press upon you. The first is, that the
decencies and gentlenesses should never be lost sight of, as
the practice of the decencies and gentlenesses is at all times
compatible with independence of thought and action. The second
thing which I would wish to impress upon you is, that there is
always some eye upon us; and that it is impossible to keep
anything we do from the world, as it will assuredly be divulged
by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do so. The third
thing which I would wish to press upon you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the youth, eagerly bending forward.</p>

<p>'Is'&mdash;and here the elderly individual laid down his pipe upon
the table&mdash;'that it will be as well to go on improving yourself
in German!'</p></div>

<p>Taylor it was who, when Borrow determined to try his fortunes in London
with those bundles of unsaleable manuscripts, gave him introductions to
Sir Richard Phillips and to Thomas Campbell. It was in the agnostic
spirit that he had learned from Taylor that he wrote during this period
to his one friend in London, Roger Kerrison. Kerrison was grandson of
Sir Roger Kerrison, Mayor of Norwich in 1778, as his son Thomas was
after him in 1806. Roger was articled, as was Borrow, to the firm of
Simpson and Rackham, while his brother Allday was in a drapery store in
Norwich, but with mind bent on commercial life in Mexico. George was
teaching him Spanish in these years as a preparation for his great
adventure. Roger had gone to London to continue his professional
experience. He finally became a Norwich solicitor and died in 1882.
Allday went to Zacatecas, Mexico, and acquired riches. John Borrow
followed him there and met with an early death, as we have seen. Borrow
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> Roger Kerrison were great friends at this time; but when <i>Lavengro</i>
was written they had ceased to be this, and Roger is described merely as
an 'acquaintance' who had found lodgings for him on his first visit to
London. As a matter of fact that trip to London was made easy for Borrow
by the opportunity given to him of sharing lodgings with Roger Kerrison
at Milman Street, Bedford Row, where Borrow put in an appearance on 1st
April 1824, some two months after the following letter was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dearest Roger</span>,&mdash;I did not imagine when we separated in the
street, on the day of your departure from Norwich, that we
should not have met again: I had intended to have come and seen
you off, but happening to dine at W. Barron's I got into
discourse, and the hour slipt past me unawares.</p>

<p>I have been again for the last fortnight laid up with that
detestable complaint which destroys my strength, impairs my
understanding, and will in all probability send me to the
grave, for I am now much worse than when you saw me last. But
<i>nil desperandum est</i>, if ever my health mends, and possibly it
may by the time my clerkship is expired, I intend to live in
London, write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion and get
myself prosecuted, for I would not for an ocean of gold remain
any longer than I am forced in this dull and gloomy town.</p>

<p>I have no news to regale you with, for there is none abroad,
but I live in the expectation of shortly hearing from you, and
being informed of your plans and projects; fear not to be
prolix, for the slightest particular cannot fail of being
interesting to one who loves you far better than parent or

<p>Borrow might improve his German&mdash;not sufficiently as we shall see in our
next chapter&mdash;but he would certainly never make a lawyer. Long years
afterwards, when, as an old man, he was frequently in Norwich, he not
seldom called at that office in Tuck's Court, where five strange years
of his life had been spent. A clerk in Rackham's office in these later
years recalls him waiting for the principal as he in his youth had
watched others waiting.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<h3>SIR RICHARD PHILLIPS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>'That's a strange man!' said I to myself, after I had left the
house, 'he is evidently very clever; but I cannot say that I
like him much with his Oxford Reviews and Dairyman's
Daughters.'</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lavengro</span>.</p></div>


<p>Borrow lost his father on the 28th February 1824. He reached London on
the 2nd April of the same year, and this was the beginning of his many
wanderings. He was armed with introductions from William Taylor, and
with some translations in manuscript from Danish and Welsh poetry. The
principal introduction was to Sir Richard Phillips, a person of some
importance in his day, who has so far received but inadequate treatment
in our own.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Phillips was active in the cause of reform at a certain
period in his life, and would seem to have had many sterling qualities
before he was spoiled by success. He was born in the neighbourhood of
Leicester, and his father was 'in the farming line,' and wanted him to
work on the farm, but he determined to seek his fortune in London. After
a short absence, during which he clearly proved to himself that he was
not at present qualified to capture London, young Phillips returned to
the farm. Borrow refers to his patron's vegetarianism, and on this point
we have an amusing story from his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> pen! He had been, when previously
on the farm, in the habit of attending to a favourite heifer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During his sojournment in London this animal had been killed;
and on the very day of his return to his father's house, he
partook of part of his favourite at dinner, without his being
made acquainted with the circumstance of its having been
slaughtered during his absence. On learning this, however, he
experienced a sudden indisposition; and declared that so great
an effect had the idea of his having eaten part of his
slaughtered favourite upon him, that he would never again taste
animal food; a vow to which he has hitherto firmly adhered.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></div>

<p>Farming not being congenial, Phillips hired a small room in Leicester,
and opened a school for instruction in the three R's, a large blue flag
on a pole being his 'sign' or signal to the inhabitants of Leicester,
who seem to have sent their children in considerable numbers to the
young schoolmaster. But little money was to be made out of schooling,
and a year later Phillips was, by the kindness of friends, started in a
small hosiery shop in Leicester. Throwing himself into politics on the
side of reform, Phillips now started the <i>Leicester Herald</i>, to which
Dr. Priestley became a contributor. The first number was issued gratis
in May 1792. His <i>Memoir</i> informs us that it was an article in this
newspaper that secured for its proprietor and editor eighteen months
imprisonment in Leicester gaol,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> but he was really charged with selling
Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i>. The worthy knight had probably grown ashamed of
<i>The Rights of Man</i> in the intervening years, and hence the reticence of
the memoir. Phillips's gaoler was the once famous Daniel Lambert, the
notorious 'fat man' of his day. In gaol Phillips was visited by Lord
Moira and the Duke of Norfolk. It was this Lord Moira who said in the
House of Lords in 1797 that 'he had seen in Ireland the most absurd, as
well as the most disgusting tyranny that any nation ever groaned under.'
Moira became Governor-General of Bengal and Commander-in-Chief of the
Army in India. The Duke of Norfolk, a stanch Whig, distinguished himself
in 1798 by a famous toast at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Arundel
Street, Strand:&mdash;'Our sovereign's health&mdash;the majesty of the people!'
which greatly offended George III., who removed Norfolk from his
lord-lieutenancy. Phillips seems to have had a very lax imprisonment, as
he conducted the <i>Herald</i> from gaol, contributing in particular a weekly
letter. Soon after his release he disposed of the <i>Herald</i>, or permitted
it to die. It was revived a few years later as an organ of Toryism. He
had started in gaol another journal, <i>The Museum</i>, and he combined this
with his hosiery business for some time longer, when an opportune fire
relieved him of an apparently uncongenial burden, and with the insurance
money in his pocket he set out for London once more. Here he started as
a hosier in St. Paul's Churchyard, lodging meantime in the house of a
milliner, where he fell in love with one of the apprentices, Miss
Griffiths, 'a native of Wales.' His affections were won, we are na&iuml;vely
informed in the <i>Memoir</i>, by the young woman's talent in the preparation
of a vegetable pie. This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> our first glimpse of Lady Phillips&mdash;'a
quiet, respectable woman,' whom Borrow was to meet at dinner long years
afterwards. Inspired, it would seem, by the kindly exhortation of Dr.
Priestley, he now transformed his hosiery business in St. Paul's
Churchyard into a 'literary repository,' and started a singularly
successful career as a publisher. There he produced his long-lived
periodical, <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, which attained to so considerable a
fame. Dr. Aikin, a friend of Priestley's, was its editor, but with him
Phillips had a quarrel&mdash;the first of his many literary quarrels&mdash;and
they separated. This Dr. Aikin was the father of the better-known Lucy
Aikin, and was a Nonconformist who suffered for his opinions in these
closing years of the eighteenth century, even as Priestley did. He was
the author of many works, including the once famous <i>Evenings at Home</i>,
written in conjunction with his sister, Mrs. Barbauld;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and after his
quarrel with Phillips he founded a new publication issued by the house
of Longman, and entitled <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>. Hereupon he and Phillips
quarrelled again, because Dr. Aikin described himself in advertisements
of <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> as 'J. Aikin, M.D., late editor of <i>The Monthly
Magazine</i>.' Aikin's contributors to <i>The Monthly</i> included Capell Lofft,
of whom we know too little, and Dr. Wolcot, of whom we know too much.
Meanwhile Phillips's publishing business grew apace, and he removed to
larger premises in Bridge Street, Blackfriars, an address which we find
upon many famous publications of his period. A catalogue of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> books
lies before me dated 'January 1805.' It includes many works still upon
our shelves. Almon's <i>Memoirs and Correspondence of John Wilkes</i>, Samuel
Richardson's <i>Life and Correspondence</i>, for example, several of the
works of Maria Edgeworth, including her <i>Moral Tales</i>, many of the works
of William Godwin, including <i>Caleb Williams</i>, and the earlier books of
that still interesting woman and once popular novelist, Lady Morgan,
whose <i>Poems</i> as Sydney Owenson bears Phillips's name on its title-page,
as does also her first successful novel <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i>, and other
of her stories. My own interest in Phillips commenced when I met him in
the pages of Lady Morgan's <i>Memoirs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Thomas Moore, Lady Morgan
tells us,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>had come back to Dublin from London, where he had been 'the
guest of princes, the friend of peers, the translator of
Anacreon!' From royal palaces and noble manors, he had returned
to his family seat&mdash;a grocer's shop at the corner of Little
Longford Street, Angier Street.</p></div>

<p>Here, in a little room over the shop, Sydney heard him sing two of his
songs, and was inspired thereby to write her first novels, <i>St. Clair</i>
and <i>The Novice of St. Dominick</i>. The first was published in Dublin;
over the second she corresponded with Phillips, and his letters to her
commence with one dated from Bridge Street, 6th April 1805, in which he
wishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> her to send the manuscript of <i>The Novice</i> to him as one 'often
(undeservedly) complimented as the most liberal of my trade!' She
determined, fresh from a governess situation, to bring the manuscript
herself. Phillips was charmed with his new author, and really seems to
have treated her very liberally. He insisted, however, on having <i>The
Novice</i> cut down from six volumes to four, and she was wont to say that
nothing but regard for her feelings prevented him from reducing it to
three.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> <i>The Novice of St. Dominick</i> was a favourite book with the
younger Pitt, who read it over again in his last illness. Then
followed&mdash;in 1806&mdash;Sydney Owenson's new novel, <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i>,
and it led to an amusing correspondence with its author on the part of
Phillips on the one side, and Johnson, who, it will be remembered, was
Cowper's publisher, on the other. Phillips was indignant that, having
first brought Sydney into fame, she should dare to ask more money on
that account. As is the case with every novelist to-day who scores one
success, Miss Owenson had formed a good idea of her value, and there is
a letter to Johnson in which she admitted that Phillips's offer was a
generous one. Johnson had offered her &pound;300 for the copyright of <i>The
Wild Irish Girl</i>. Phillips had offered only &pound;200 down and &pound;50 each for
the second and third editions. When Phillips heard that Johnson had
outbidden him, he described the offer as 'monstrous,' and that it was
'inspired by a spirit of revenge.' He would not, he declared, increase
his offer, but a little later he writes from Bridge Street to Sydney
Owenson as his 'dear, bewitching, and deluding Syren,' and promises the
&pound;300. A few months later he gave her a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> pounds for a slight
volume of poems, which certainly never paid for its publication,
although Scott and Moore and many another were making much money out of
poetry in those days. In any case Phillips did not accept Miss Owenson's
next story with alacrity, in spite of the undoubted success of <i>The Wild
Irish Girl</i>. She no doubt asked too much for <i>Ida of Athens</i>. Phillips
probably thought, after reading the first volume in type, that it was
very inferior work, as indeed it was. Athens was described without the
author ever having seen the city. After much wrangling, in which the
lady said that her 'prince of publishers,' as she had once called him,
had 'treated her barbarously,' the novel went into the hands of the
Longmans, who published it, not without some remonstrance as to certain
of its sentiments. The successful Lady Morgan afterwards described <i>Ida</i>
as a bad book, so perhaps here, as usually, Phillips was not far wrong
in his judgment. A similar quarrel seems to have taken place over the
next novel, <i>The Missionary</i>. Here Phillips again received the
manuscript, discussed terms with its author, and returned it. The firm
of Stockdale and Miller were his successful rivals. Later and more
prosperous novels, <i>O'Donnel</i> in particular, were issued by Henry
Colburn, and Phillips now disappears from Lady Morgan's life. I have
told the story of Phillips's relation with Lady Morgan at length because
at no other point do we come into so near a contact with him. In Fell's
<i>Memoir</i> Phillips is described&mdash;in 1808&mdash;as 'certainly now the first
publisher in London,' but while he may have been this in the volume of
his trade&mdash;and school-books made an important part of it&mdash;he was not in
mere 'names.' Most of his successful writers&mdash;Sydney Owenson, Thomas
Skinner Surr,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Dr. Gregory, and the rest&mdash;have now fallen into oblivion.
The school-books that he issued have lasted even to our own day, notably
Dr. Mavor's <i>Spelling Book</i>. Dr. Mavor was a Scotsman from Aberdeen, who
came to London and became Phillips's chief hack. There are no less than
twenty of Mavor's school-books in the catalogue before me. They include
Mavor's <i>History of England</i>, Mavor's <i>Universal History</i>, and Mavor's
<i>History of Greece</i>. In the <i>Memoir</i> of 1808 it is claimed that 'Mavor'
is but a pseudonym for Phillips, and the claim is also made, quite
wrongfully, by John Timbs, who, before he became acting editor of the
<i>Illustrated London News</i> under Herbert Ingram, and an indefatigable
author, was Phillips's private secretary.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It seems clear, however,
that in the case of Blair's <i>Catechism</i> and Goldsmith's <i>Geography</i>, and
many another book for schools, Phillips was 'Blair' and 'Goldsmith' and
many another imaginary person, for the books in question numbered about
two hundred in all. For these books there must have been quite an army
of literary hacks employed during the twenty years prior to the
appearance of George Borrow in that great army. On 9th November 1807,
the Lord Mayor's procession through London included Richard Phillips
among its sheriffs, and he was knighted by George III. in the following
year. During his period of office he effected many reforms in the City
prisons. John Timbs, in his <i>Walks and Talks about London</i>, tells us
that Phillips's colleague in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> shrievalty was one Smith, who
afterwards became Lord Mayor:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>personnel</i> of the two sheriffs presented a sharp contrast.
Smith loved aldermanic cheer, but was pale and cadaverous in
complexion; whilst Phillips, who never ate animal food, was
rosy and healthful in appearance. One day, when the sheriffs
were in full state, the procession was stopped by an
obstruction in the street traffic; when droll were the mistakes
of the mob: to Smith they cried, 'Here's Old Water-gruel!' to
Phillips, 'Here's Roast Beef! something like an Englishman!'</p></div>

<p>Two volumes before me show Phillips as the precursor of many of the
publishers of one-volume books of reference so plentiful in our day. <i>A
Million of Facts</i> is one of them, and <i>A Chronology of Public Events
Within the Last Fifty Years from 1771 to 1821</i> is another, while one of
the earliest and most refreshing guides to London and its neighbourhood
is afforded us in <i>A Morning Walk from London to Kew</i>, which first
appeared in <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, but was reprinted in 1817 with the
name 'Sir Richard Phillips' as author on the title-page. Phillips was
now no longer a publisher. Here we have some pleasant glimpses of a
bygone era, many trite reflections, but not enough topography to make
the book one of permanent interest. It would not, in fact, be worth
reprinting.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>This, then, was the man to whom George Borrow presented himself in 1824.
Phillips was fifty-seven years of age. He had made a moderate fortune
and lost it, and was now enjoying another perhaps less satisfying; it
included the profits of <i>The Monthly Review</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> repurchased after his
bankruptcy, and some rights in many of the school-books. But the great
publishing establishment in Bridge Street had long been broken up.
Borrow would have found Taylor's introduction to Phillips quite useless
had the worthy knight not at the moment been keen on a new magazine and
seen the importance of a fresh 'hack' to help to run it. Moreover, had
he not written a great book which only the Germans could appreciate,
<i>Twelve Essays on the Phenomena of Nature</i>? Here, he thought, was the
very man to produce this book in a German dress. Taylor was a thorough
German scholar, and he had vouched for the excellent German of his pupil
and friend. Hence a certain cordiality which did not win Borrow's
regard, but was probably greater than many a young man would receive
to-day from a publisher-prince upon whom he might call laden only with a
bundle of translations from the Danish and the Welsh. Here&mdash;in
<i>Lavengro</i>&mdash;is the interview between publisher and poet, with the
editor's factotum Bartlett, whom Borrow calls Taggart, as witness:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Well, sir, what is your pleasure?' said the big man, in a
rough tone, as I stood there, looking at him wistfully&mdash;as well
I might&mdash;for upon that man, at the time of which I am speaking,
my principal, I may say my only hopes, rested.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said I, 'my name is So-and-so, and I am the bearer of a
letter to you from Mr. So-and-so, an old friend and
correspondent of yours.'</p>

<p>The countenance of the big man instantly lost the suspicious
and lowering expression which it had hitherto exhibited; he
strode forward and, seizing me by the hand, gave me a violent
squeeze.</p>

<p>'My dear sir,' said he, 'I am rejoiced to see you in London. I
have been long anxious for the pleasure&mdash;we are old friends,
though we have never before met. Taggart,' said he to the man
who sat at the desk, 'this is our excellent correspondent, the
friend and pupil of our excellent correspondent.'</p></div>

<h3>FRIENDS OF BORROW'S EARLY YEARS</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>Phillips explains that he has given up publishing, except 'under the
rose,' had only <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, here<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> called <i>The Magazine</i>,
but contemplated yet another monthly, <i>The Universal Review</i>, here
called <i>The Oxford</i>. He gave Borrow much the same sound advice that a
publisher would have given him to-day&mdash;that poetry is not a marketable
commodity, and that if you want to succeed in prose you must, as a rule,
write trash&mdash;the most acceptable trash of that day being <i>The Dairyman's
Daughter</i>,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which has sold in hundreds of thousands, and is still
much prized by the Evangelical folk who buy the publications of the
Religious Tract Society. Phillips, moreover, asked him to dine to meet
his wife, his son, and his son's wife,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and we know what an amusing
account of that dinner Borrow gives in <i>Lavengro</i>. Moreover, he set
Borrow upon his first piece of hack-work, the <i>Celebrated Trials</i>, and
gave him something to do upon <i>The Universal Review</i> and also upon <i>The
Monthly</i>. <i>The Universal</i> lasted only for six numbers, dying in January
1825. In that year appeared the six volumes of the <i>Celebrated Trials</i>,
of which we have something to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> say in our next chapter. Borrow found
Phillips most exacting, always suggesting the names of new criminals,
and leaving it to the much sweated author to find the books from which
to extract the necessary material:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the compilation of my Lives and Trials I was exposed to
incredible mortification, and ceaseless trouble, from this same
rage for interference.... This was not all; when about a moiety
of the first volume had been printed, he materially altered the
plan of the work; it was no longer to be a collection of mere
Newgate lives and trials, but of lives and trials of criminals
in general, foreign as well as domestic.... 'Where is Brandt
and Struensee?' cried the publisher. 'I am sure I don't know,'
I replied; whereupon the publisher falls to squealing like one
of Joey's rats. 'Find me up Brandt and Struensee by next
morning, or&mdash;' 'Have you found Brandt and Struensee?' cried the
publisher, on my appearing before him next morning. 'No,' I
reply, 'I can hear nothing about them'; whereupon the publisher
falls to bellowing like Joey's bull. By dint of incredible
diligence, I at length discover the dingy volume containing the
lives and trials of the celebrated two who had brooded treason
dangerous to the state of Denmark. I purchase the dingy volume,
and bring it in triumph to the publisher, the perspiration
running down my brow. The publisher takes the dingy volume in
his hand, he examines it attentively, then puts it down; his
countenance is calm for a moment, almost benign. Another moment
and there is a gleam in the publisher's sinister eye; he
snatches up the paper containing the names of the worthies
which I have intended shall figure in the forthcoming
volumes&mdash;he glances rapidly over it, and his countenance once
more assumes a terrific expression. 'How is this?' he exclaims;
'I can scarcely believe my eyes&mdash;the most important life and
trial omitted to be found in the whole criminal record&mdash;what
gross, what utter negligence! Where's the life of Farmer Patch?
where's the trial of Yeoman Patch?'</p>

<p>'What a life! what a dog's life!' I would frequently exclaim,
after escaping from the presence of the publisher.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the final catastrophe. Borrow could not translate Phillips's
great masterpiece, <i>Twelve Essays on the Proximate Causes</i>, into German
with any real effectiveness although the testimonial of the enthusiastic
Taylor had led Phillips to assume that he could. Borrow, as we shall
see, knew many languages, and knew them well colloquially, but he was
not a grammarian, and he could not write accurately in any one of his
numerous tongues. His wonderful memory gave him the words, but not
always any thoroughness of construction. He could make a good
translation of a poem by Schiller, because he brought his own poetic
fancy to the venture, but he had no interest in Phillips's philosophy,
and so he doubtless made a very bad translation, as German friends were
soon able to assure Phillips, who had at last to go to a German for a
translation, and the book appeared at Stuttgart in 1826.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Meanwhile,
Phillips's new magazine, <i>The Universal Review</i>, went on its course. It
lasted only for a few numbers, as we have said&mdash;from March 1824 to
January 1825&mdash;and it was entirely devoted to reviews, many of them
written by Borrow, but without any distinction calling for comment
to-day. Dr. Knapp thought that Gifford was the editor, with Phillips's
son and George Borrow assisting. Gifford translated <i>Juvenal</i>, and it
was for a long time assumed that Borrow wished merely to disguise
Gifford's identity when he referred to his editor as the translator of
<i>Quintilian</i>. But Sir Leslie Stephen has pointed out in <i>Literature</i>
that John Carey (1756-1826), who actually edited <i>Quintilian</i> in 1822,
was Phillips's editor, 'All the poetry which I reviewed,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> Borrow tells
us, 'appeared to be published at the expense of the authors. All the
publications which fell under my notice I treated in a gentlemanly ...
manner&mdash;no personalities, no vituperation, no shabby insinuations;
decorum, decorum was the order of the day.' And one feels that Borrow
was not very much at home. But he went on with his <i>Newgate Lives and
Trials</i>, which, however, were to be published with another imprint,
although at the instance of Phillips. By that time he and that worthy
publisher had parted company. Probably Phillips had set out for
Brighton, which was to be his home for the remainder of his life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><i>FAUSTUS</i> AND <i>ROMANTIC BALLADS</i></h3>


<p>In the early pages of <i>Lavengro</i> Borrow tells us nearly all we are ever
likely to know of his sojourn in London in the years 1824 and 1825,
during which time he had those interviews with Sir Richard Phillips
which are recorded in our last chapter. Dr. Knapp, indeed, prints a
little note from him to his friend Kerrison, in which he begs his friend
to come to him as he believes he is dying. Roger Kerrison, it would
seem, had been so frightened by Borrow's depression and threats of
suicide that he had left the lodgings at 16 Milman Street, Bedford Row,
and removed himself elsewhere, and so Borrow was left friendless to
fight what he called his 'horrors' alone. The depression was not
unnatural. From his own vivid narrative we learn of Borrow's bitter
failure as an author. No one wanted his translations from the Welsh and
the Danish, and Phillips clearly had no further use for him after he had
compiled his <i>Newgate Lives and Trials</i> (Borrow's name in <i>Lavengro</i> for
<i>Celebrated Trials</i>), and was doubtless inclined to look upon him as an
impostor for professing, with William Taylor's sanction, a mastery of
the German language which had been demonstrated to be false with regard
to his own book. No 'spirited publisher' had come forward to give
reality to his dream thus set down:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I had still an idea that, provided I could persuade any
spirited publisher to give these translations to the world, I
should acquire both considerable fame and profit; not, perhaps,
a world-embracing fame such as Byron's; but a fame not to be
sneered at, which would last me a considerable time, and would
keep my heart from breaking;&mdash;profit, not equal to that which
Scott had made by his wondrous novels, but which would prevent
me from starving, and enable me to achieve some other literary
enterprise. I read and re-read my ballads, and the more I read
them the more I was convinced that the public, in the event of
their being published, would freely purchase, and hail them
with the merited applause.</p></div>

<p>He has a tale to tell us in <i>Lavengro</i> of a certain <i>Life and Adventures
of Joseph Sell, the Great Traveller</i>, the purchase of which from him by
a publisher at the last moment saved him from starvation and enabled him
to take to the road, there to meet the many adventures that have become
immortal in the pages of <i>Lavengro</i>. Dr. Knapp has encouraged the idea
that <i>Joseph Sell</i> was a real book, ignoring the fact that the very
title suggests doubts, and was probably meant to suggest them. In
Norfolk, as elsewhere, a 'sell' is a word in current slang used for an
imposture or a cheat, and doubtless Borrow meant to make merry with the
credulous. There was, we may be perfectly sure, no <i>Joseph Sell</i>, and it
is more reasonable to suppose that it was the sale of his translation of
Klinger's <i>Faustus</i> that gave him the much needed money at this crisis.
Dr. Knapp pictures Borrow as carrying the manuscript of his translation
of <i>Faustus</i> with him to London. There is not the slightest evidence of
this. It may be reasonably assumed that Borrow made the translation from
Klinger's novel during his sojourn in London. It is true the preface is
dated 'Norwich, April 1825,' but Borrow did not leave London until the
end of May 1825, that is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> say, until after he had negotiated with 'W.
Simpkin and R. Marshall,' now the well-known firm of Simpkin and
Marshall, for the publication of the little volume. That firm,
unfortunately, has no record of the transaction. My impression is that
Borrow in his wandering after old volumes on crime for his great
compilation, <i>Celebrated Trials</i>, came across the French translation of
Klinger's novel published at Amsterdam. From that translation he
acknowledges that he borrowed the plate which serves as frontispiece&mdash;a
plate entitled 'The Corporation Feast.' It represents the corporation of
Frankfort at a banquet turned by the devil into various animals. It has
been erroneously assumed that Borrow had had something to do with the
designing of this plate, and that he had introduced the corporation of
Norwich in vivid portraiture into the picture. Borrow does, indeed,
interpolate a reference to Norwich into his translation of a not too
complimentary character, for at that time he had no very amiable
feelings towards his native city. Of the inhabitants of Frankfort he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly
a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features, that the
devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the
inhabitants of an English town called Norwich, when dressed in
their Sunday's best.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></div>

<p>In the original German version of 1791 we have the town of Nuremberg
thus satirised. But Borrow was not the first translator to seize the
opportunity of adapting the reference for personal ends. In the French
translation of 1798, published at Amsterdam, and entitled <i>Les Aventures
du Docteur Faust</i>, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> translator has substituted Auxerre for
Nuremberg. What makes me think that Borrow used only the French version
in his translation is the fact that in his preface he refers to the
engravings of that version, one of which he reproduced; whereas the
engravings are in the German version as well.</p>

<p>Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger (1752-1831), who was responsible for
Borrow's 'first book,' was responsible for much else of an epoch-making
character. It was he who by one of his many plays, <i>Sturm und Drang</i>,
gave a name to an important period of German Literature. In 1780 von
Klinger entered the service of Russia, and in 1790 married a natural
daughter of the Empress Catherine. Thus his novel, <i>Faust's Leben,
Thaten und H&ouml;llenfahrt</i>, was actually first published at St. Petersburg
in 1791. This was seventeen years before Goethe published his first part
of <i>Faust</i>, a book which by its exquisite poetry was to extinguish for
all self-respecting Germans Klinger's turgid prose. Borrow, like the
translator of Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i> and of many another classic,
takes refuge more than once in the asterisk. Klinger's <i>Faustus</i>, with
much that was bad and even bestial, has merits. The devil throughout
shows his victim a succession of examples of 'man's inhumanity to man.'
Borrow's translation of Klinger's novel was reprinted in 1864 without
any acknowledgment of the name of the translator, and only a few stray
words being altered.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Borrow nowhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> mentions Klinger's name in his
latter volume, of which the title-page runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Faustus: His Life, Death, and Descent into Hell. Translated
from the German. London: W. Simpkin and R. Marshall, 1825.</p></div>

<p>I doubt very much if he really knew who was the author, as the book in
both the German editions I have seen as well as in the French version
bears no author's name on its title-page. A letter of Borrow's in the
possession of an American collector indicates that he was back in
Norwich in September 1825, after, we may assume, three months' wandering
among gypsies and tinkers. It is written from Willow Lane, and is
apparently to the publishers of <i>Faustus</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As your bill will become payable in a few days, I am willing to
take thirty copies of <i>Faustus</i> instead of the money. The book
has been <i>burnt</i> in both the libraries here, and, as it has
been talked about, I may perhaps be able to dispose of some in
the course of a year or so.</p></div>

<p>This letter clearly demonstrates that the guileless Simpkin and the
equally guileless Marshall had paid Borrow for the right to publish
<i>Faustus</i>, and even though part of the payment was met by a bill, I
think we may safely find in the transaction whatever verity there may be
in the Joseph Sell episode. 'Let me know how you sold your manuscript,'
writes Borrow's brother to him so late as the year 1829. And this was
doubtless <i>Faustus</i>. The action of the Norwich libraries in burning the
book would clearly have had the sympathy of one of its few reviewers had
he been informed of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> circumstance. It is thus that the <i>Literary
Gazette</i> for 16th July 1825 refers to Borrow's little book:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is another work to which no respectable publisher ought to
have allowed his name to be put. The political allusions and
metaphysics, which may have made it popular among a low class
in Germany, do not sufficiently season its lewd scenes and
coarse descriptions for British palates. We have occasionally
publications for the fireside&mdash;these are only fit for the fire.</p></div>

<p>Borrow returned then to Norwich in the autumn of 1825 a disappointed man
so far as concerned the giving of his poetical translations to the
world, from which he had hoped so much. No 'spirited publisher' had been
forthcoming, although Dr. Knapp's researches have unearthed a 'note' in
<i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, which, after the fashion of the anticipatory
literary gossip of our day, announced that Olaus Borrow was about to
issue <i>Legends and Popular Superstitions of the North</i>, 'in two elegant
volumes.' But this never appeared. Quite a number of Borrow's
translations from divers languages had appeared from time to time,
beginning with a version of Schiller's 'Diver' in <i>The New Monthly
Magazine</i> for 1823, continuing with Stolberg's 'Ode to a Mountain
Torrent' in <i>The Monthly Magazine</i>, and including the 'Deceived Merman.'
These he collected into book form and, not to be deterred by the
coldness of heartless London publishers, issued them by subscription.
Three copies of the slim octavo book lie before me, with separate
title-pages:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish; and
Miscellaneous Pieces by George Borrow. Norwich: Printed and
Published by S. Wilkin, Upper Haymarket, 1826.</p>

<p>(2) Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish; and
Miscellaneous Pieces by George Borrow. London: Published by
John Taylor, Waterloo Place, Pall Mall, 1826.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish; and
Miscellaneous Pieces, by George Borrow. London: Published by
Wightman and Cramp, 24 Paternoster Row, 1826.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p></div>

<p>The book contains an introduction in verse by Allan Cunningham, whose
acquaintance Borrow seems to have made in London. It commences:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Sing, sing, my friend, breathe life again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Through Norway's song and Denmark's strain:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">On flowing Thames and Forth, in flood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Pour Haco's war-song, fierce and rude.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Cunningham had not himself climbed very far up the literary ladder in
1825, although he was forty-one years of age. At one time a stonemason
in a Scots village, he had entered Chantrey's studio, and was
'superintendent of the works' to that eminent sculptor at the time when
Borrow called upon him in London, and made an acquaintance which never
seems to have extended beyond this courtesy to the younger man's <i>Danish
Ballads</i>. The point of sympathy of course was that in the year 1825
Cunningham had published <i>The Songs of Scotland, Ancient and Modern</i>.
But Allan Cunningham, whose <i>Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters</i>
is his best remembered book to-day, scarcely comes into this story.
There are four letters from Cunningham to Borrow in Dr. Knapp's <i>Life</i>,
and two from Borrow to Cunningham. The latter gave his young friend much
good advice. He told him, for example, to send copies of his book to the
newspapers&mdash;to the <i>Literary Gazette</i> in particular, and 'Walter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> Scott
must not be forgotten.' Dr. Knapp thinks that the newspapers were
forgotten, and that Borrow neglected to send to them. In any case not a
single review appeared. But it is not exactly true that Borrow ignored
the usual practice of authors so entirely as Dr. Knapp supposes. There
is a letter to Borrow among my Borrow Papers from Francis Palgrave the
historian, who became Sir Francis Palgrave seven years later, which
throws some light upon the subject:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Parliament St.</span>, <i>17 June 1826.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you for the opportunity
that you have afforded me of perusing your spirited and
faithful translating of the Danish ballads. Mr. Allan
Cunningham, who, as you will know, is an ancient minstrel
himself, says that they are more true to the originals and more
truly poetical than any that he has yet seen. I have delivered
one copy to Mr. Lockhart, the new editor of the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, and I hope he will notice it as it deserves. Murray
would probably be inclined to publish your translations.&mdash;I
remain, dear sir, your obedient and faithful servant,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Francis Palgrave.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>It is probable that he did also send a copy to Scott, and it is Dr.
Knapp's theory that 'that busy writer forgot to acknowledge the
courtesy.' It may be that this is so. It has been the source of many a
literary prejudice. Carlyle had a bitterness in his heart against Scott
for much the same cause. Rarely indeed can the struggling author endure
to be ignored by the radiantly successful one. It must have been the
more galling in that a few years earlier Scott had been lifted by the
ballad from obscurity to fame. Borrow did not in any case lack
encouragement from Allan Cunningham: 'I like your Danish ballads much,'
he writes. 'Get out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> bed, George Borrow, and be sick or sleepy no
longer. A fellow who can give us such exquisite Danish ballads has no
right to repose.'<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Borrow, on his side, thanks Cunningham for his
'noble lines,' and tells him that he has got 'half of his <i>Songs of
Scotland</i> by heart.'</p>

<p>Five hundred copies of the <i>Romantic Ballads</i> were printed in Norwich by
S. Wilkin, about two hundred being subscribed for, mainly in that city,
the other three hundred being dispatched to London&mdash;to Taylor, whose
name appears on the London title-page, although he seems to have passed
on the book very quickly to Wightman and Cramp, for what reason we are
not informed. Borrow tells us that the two hundred subscriptions of half
a guinea 'amply paid expenses,' but he must have been cruelly
disappointed, as he was doomed to be more than once in his career, by
the lack of public appreciation outside of Norwich. Yet there were many
reasons for this. If Scott had made the ballad popular, he had also
destroyed it for a century&mdash;perhaps for ever&mdash;by substituting the novel
as the favourite medium for the storyteller. Great ballads we were to
have in every decade from that day to this, but never another 'best
seller' like <i>Marmion</i> or <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>. Our <i>popular</i> poets
had to express themselves in other ways. Then Borrow, although his verse
has been underrated by those who have not seen it at its best, or who
are incompetent to appraise poetry, was not very effective here,
notwithstanding that the stories in verse in <i>Romantic Ballads</i> are all
entirely interesting. This fact is most in evidence in a case where a
real poet, not of the greatest, has told the same story. We owe a
rendering of 'The Deceived Merman'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> to both George Borrow and Matthew
Arnold, but how widely different the treatment! The story is of a merman
who rose out of the water and enticed a mortal&mdash;fair Agnes or
Margaret&mdash;under the waves; she becomes his wife, bears him children, and
then asks to return to earth. Arriving there she refuses to go back when
the merman comes disconsolately to the churchdoor for her. Here are a
few lines from the two versions, which demonstrate that here at least
Borrow was no poet and that Arnold was a very fine one:</p>



<div class='center'>

</table></div>

<p>It says much for the literary proclivities of Norwich at this period
that Borrow should have had so kindly a reception for his book as the
subscription list implies. At the end of each of Wilkin's two hundred
copies a 'list of subscribers' is given. It opens with the name of the
Bishop of Norwich, Dr. Bathurst; it includes the equally familiar names
of the Gurdons, Gurneys, Harveys, Rackhams, Hares (then as now of Stow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Hall), Woodhouses&mdash;all good Norfolk or Norwich names that have come down
to our time. Mayor Hawkes, who is made famous in <i>Lavengro</i> by Haydon's
portrait, is there also. Among London names we find 'F. Arden,' which
recalls his friend 'Francis Ardry' in <i>Lavengro</i>, John Bowring, Borrow's
new friend, and later to be counted an enemy, Thomas Campbell, Benjamin
Haydon, and John Timbs, But the name that most strikes the eye is that
of 'Thurtell.' Three of the family are among the subscribers, including
Mr. George Thurtell of Eaton, near Norwich, brother of the murderer;
there also is the name of John Thurtell, executed for murder exactly a
year before. This would seem to imply that Borrow had been a long time
collecting these names and subscriptions, and doubtless before the
all-too-famous crime of the previous year he had made Thurtell promise
to become a subscriber, and, let us hope, had secured his half-guinea.
That may account, with so sensitive and impressionable a man as our
author, for the kindly place that Weare's unhappy murderer always had in
his memory. Borrow, in any case, was now, for a few years, to become
more than ever a vagabond. Not a single further appeal did he make to an
unsympathetic literary public for a period of five years at least.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><i>CELEBRATED TRIALS</i> AND JOHN THURTELL</h3>


<p>Borrow's first book was <i>Faustus</i>, and his second was <i>Romantic
Ballads</i>, the one being published, as we have seen, in 1825, the other
in 1826. This chronology has the appearance of ignoring the <i>Celebrated
Trials</i>, but then it is scarcely possible to count <i>Celebrated
Trials</i><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> as one of Borrow's books at all. It is largely a
compilation, exactly as the <i>Newgate Calendar</i> and Howell's <i>State
Trials</i> are compilations. In his preface to the work Borrow tells us
that he has differentiated the book from the <i>Newgate Calendar</i><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and
the <i>State Trials</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> by the fact that he had made considerable
compression. This was so, and in fact in many cases he has used the blue
pencil rather than the pen&mdash;at least in the earlier volumes. But Borrow
attempted something much more comprehensive than the <i>Newgate Calendar</i>
and the <i>State Trials</i> in his book. In the former work the trials range
from 1700 to 1802; in the latter from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> trial of Becket in 1163 to
the trial of Thistlewood in 1820. Both works are concerned solely with
this country. Borrow went all over Europe, and the trials of Joan of
Arc, Count Struensee, Major Andr&eacute;, Count Cagliostro, Queen Marie
Antoinette, the Duc d'Enghien, and Marshal Ney, are included in his
volumes. Moreover, while what may be called state trials are numerous,
including many of the cases in <i>Howell</i>, the greater number are of a
domestic nature, including nearly all that are given in the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i>. In the first two volumes he has naturally mainly state trials
to record; the later volumes record sordid everyday crimes, and here
Borrow is more at home. His style when he rewrites the trials is more
vigorous, and his narrative more interesting. It is to be hoped that the
exigent publisher, who he assures us made him buy the books for his
compilation out of the &pound;50 that he paid for it, was able to present him
with a set of the <i>State Trials</i>, if only in one of the earlier and
cheaper issues of the work than the one that now has a place in every
lawyer's library.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The third volume of <i>Celebrated Trials</i>, although it opens with the
trial of Algernon Sidney, is made up largely of crime of the more
ordinary type, and this sordid note continues through the three final
volumes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> I have said that <i>Faustus</i> is an allegory of 'man's inhumanity
to man.' That is emphatically, in more realistic form, the
distinguishing feature of <i>Celebrated Trials</i>. Amid these records of
savagery, it is a positive relief to come across such a trial as that of
poor Joseph Baretti. Baretti, it will be remembered, was brought to
trial because, when some roughs set upon him in the street, he drew a
dagger, which he usually carried 'to carve fruit and sweetmeats,' and
killed his assailant. In that age, when our law courts were a veritable
shambles, how cheerful it is to find that the jury returned a verdict of
'self-defence.' But then Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, Dr. Johnson,
and David Garrick gave evidence to character, representing Baretti as 'a
man of benevolence, sobriety, modesty, and learning.' This trial is an
oasis of mercy in a desert of drastic punishment. Borrow carries on his
'trials' to the very year before the date of publication, and the last
trial in the book is that of 'Henry Fauntleroy, Esquire,' for forgery.
Fauntleroy was a quite respectable banker of unimpeachable character, to
whom had fallen at a very early age the charge of a banking business
that was fundamentally unsound. It is clear that he had honestly
endeavoured to put things on a better footing, that he lived simply, and
had no gambling or other vices. At a crisis, however, he forged a
document, in other words signed a transfer of stock which he had no
right to do, the 'subscribing witness' to his power of attorney being
Robert Browning, a clerk in the Bank of England, and father of the
distinguished poet.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Well, Fauntleroy was sentenced to be hanged&mdash;and
he was duly hanged at Newgate on 30th October<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> 1824, only thirteen years
before Queen Victoria came to the throne!</p>

<p>Borrow has affirmed that from a study of the <i>Newgate Calendar</i> and the
compilation of his <i>Celebrated Trials</i> he first learned to write genuine
English, and it is a fact that there are some remarkably dramatic
effects in these volumes, although one here withholds from Borrow the
title of 'author' because so much is 'scissors and paste,' and the
purple passages are only occasional. All the same I am astonished that
no one has thought it worth while to make a volume of these dramatic
episodes, which are clearly the work of Borrow, and owe nothing to the
innumerable pamphlets and chap-books that he brought into use. Take such
an episode as that of Schening and Harlin, two young German women, one
of whom pretended to have murdered her infant in the presence of the
other because she madly supposed that this would secure them bread&mdash;and
they were starving. The trial, the scene at the execution, the
confession on the scaffold of the misguided but innocent girl, the
respite, and then the execution&mdash;these make up as thrilling a narrative
as is contained in the pages of fiction. Assuredly Borrow did not spare
himself in that race round the bookstalls of London to find the material
which the grasping Sir Richard Phillips required from him. He found, for
example, Sir Herbert Croft's volume, <i>Love and Madness</i>, the supposed
correspondence of Parson Hackman and Martha Reay, whom he murdered. That
correspondence is now known to be an invention of Croft's. Borrow
accepted it as genuine, and incorporated the whole of it in his story of
the Hackman trial.</p>

<p>But after all, the trial which we read with greatest interest in these
six volumes is that of John Thurtell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> because Borrow had known Thurtell
in his youth, and gives us more than one glimpse of him in <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>The Romany Rye</i>. We recall, for example, Lavengro's interview with
the magistrate when a visitor is announced:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In what can I oblige you, sir?' said the magistrate.</p>

<p>'Well, sir; the soul of wit is brevity; we want a place for an
approaching combat between my friend here and a brave from
town. Passing by your broad acres this fine morning we saw a
pightle, which we deemed would suit. Lend us that pightle, and
receive our thanks; 'twould be a favour, though not much to
grant: we neither ask for Stonehenge nor for Tempe.'</p>

<p>My friend looked somewhat perplexed; after a moment, however,
he said, with a firm but gentlemanly air, 'Sir, I am sorry that
I cannot comply with your request.'</p>

<p>'Not comply!' said the man, his brow becoming dark as midnight;
and with a hoarse and savage tone, 'Not comply! why not?'</p>

<p>'It is impossible, sir&mdash;utterly impossible!'</p>

<p>'Why so?'</p>

<p>'I am not compelled to give my reasons to you, sir, nor to any
man.'</p>

<p>'Let me beg of you to alter your decision,' said the man, in a
tone of profound respect.</p>

<p>'Utterly impossible, sir; I am a magistrate.'</p>

<p>'Magistrate! then fare-ye-well, for a green-coated buffer and a
Harmanbeck.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the magistrate, springing up with a face fiery with
wrath.</p>

<p>But, with a surly nod to me, the man left the apartment; and in
a moment more the heavy footsteps of himself and his companion
were heard descending the staircase.</p>

<p>'Who is that man?' said my friend, turning towards me.</p>

<p>'A sporting gentleman, well known in the place from which I
come.'</p>

<p>'He appeared to know you.'</p>

<p>'I have occasionally put on the gloves with him.'</p>

<p>'What is his name?'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>In the original manuscript in my possession the name 'John Thurtell' is
given as the answer to that inquiry. In the printed book the chapter
ends more abruptly as we see. The second reference is even more
dramatic. It occurs when Lavengro has a conversation with his friend the
gypsy Petulengro in a thunderstorm&mdash;when all are hurrying to the
prize-fight. Here let Borrow tell his story:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Look up there, brother!'</p>

<p>I looked up. Connected with this tempest there was one feature
to which I have already alluded&mdash;the wonderful colours of the
clouds. Some were of vivid green, others of the brightest
orange, others as black as pitch. The gypsy's finger was
pointed to a particular part of the sky.</p>

<p>'What do you see there, brother?'</p>

<p>'A strange kind of cloud.'</p>

<p>'What does it look like, brother?'</p>

<p>'Something like a stream of blood.'</p>

<p>'That cloud foreshoweth a bloody dukkeripen.'</p>

<p>'A bloody fortune!' said I. 'And whom may it betide?'</p>

<p>'Who knows?' said the gypsy.</p>

<p>Down the way, dashing and splashing, and scattering man, horse,
and cart to the left and right, came an open barouche, drawn by
four smoking steeds, with postillions in scarlet jackets and
leather skull-caps. Two forms were conspicuous in it&mdash;that of
the successful bruiser, and of his friend and backer, the
sporting gentleman of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>'His!' said the gypsy, pointing to the latter, whose stern
features wore a smile of triumph, as, probably recognising me
in the crowd, he nodded in the direction of where I stood, as
the barouche hurried by.</p>

<p>There went the barouche, dashing through the rain-gushes, and
in it one whose boast it was that he was equal to 'either
fortune.' Many have heard of that man&mdash;many may be desirous of
knowing yet more of him. I have nothing to do with that man's
after life&mdash;he fulfilled his dukkeripen. 'A bad, violent man!'
Softly, friend; when thou wouldst speak harshly of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> the dead,
remember that thou hast not yet fulfilled thy own dukkeripen!</p></div>

<p>There is yet another reference by Borrow to Thurtell in <i>The Gypsies of
Spain</i>, which runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When a boy of fourteen I was present at a prize-fight; why
should I hide the truth? It took place on a green meadow,
beside a running stream, close by the old church of E&mdash;&mdash;, and
within a league of the ancient town of N&mdash;&mdash;, the capital of
one of the eastern counties. The terrible Thurtell was present,
lord of the concourse; for wherever he moved he was master, and
whenever he spoke, even when in chains, every other voice was
silent. He stood on the mead, grim and pale as usual, with his
bruisers around. He it was, indeed, who <i>got up</i> the fight, as
he had previously done twenty others; it being his frequent
boast that he had first introduced bruising and bloodshed
amidst rural scenes, and transformed a quiet slumbering town
into a den of Jews and metropolitan thieves.</p></div>

<p>Rarely in our criminal jurisprudence has a murder trial excited more
interest than that of John Thurtell for the murder of Weare&mdash;the Gill's
Hill Murder, as it was called. Certainly no murder of modern times has
had so many indirect literary associations. Borrow, Carlyle, Hazlitt,
Walter Scott, and Thackeray are among those who have given it lasting
fame by comment of one kind or another; and the lines ascribed to
Theodore Hook are perhaps as well known as any other memory of the
tragedy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They cut his throat from ear to ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His brain they battered in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name was Mr. William Weare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He dwelt in Lyon's Inn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Carlyle's division of human beings of the upper classes into 'noblemen,
gentlemen, and gigmen,' which occurs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> in his essay on Richter, and a
later reference to gig-manhood which occurs in his essay on Goethe's
Works, had their inspiration in an episode in the trial of Thurtell,
when the question being asked, 'What sort of a person was Mr. Weare?'
brought the answer, 'He was always a respectable person.' 'What do you
mean by respectable?' the witness was asked. 'He kept a gig,' was the
reply, which brought the word 'gigmanity' into our language.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>I have said that John Thurtell and two members of his family became
subscribers for Borrow's <i>Romantic Ballads</i>,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and it is certain that
Borrow must often have met Thurtell, that is to say looked at him from a
distance, in some of the scenes of prize-fighting which both affected,
Borrow merely as a youthful spectator, Thurtell as a reckless backer of
one or other combatant. Thurtell's father was an alderman of Norwich
living in a good house on the Ipswich Road when the son's name rang
through England as that of a murderer. The father was born in 1765 and
died in 1846. Four years after his son John was hanged he was elected
Mayor of Norwich, in recognition of his violent ultra-Whig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> or blue and
white political opinions. He had been nominated as mayor both in 1818
and 1820, but it was perhaps the extraordinary 'advertisement' of his
son's shameful death that gave the citizens of Norwich the necessary
enthusiasm to elect Alderman Thurtell as mayor in 1828. It was in those
oligarchical days a not unnatural fashion to be against the Government.
The feast at the Guildhall on this occasion was attended by four hundred
and sixty guests. A year before John Thurtell was hanged, in 1823, his
father moved a violent political resolution in Norwich, but was
out-Heroded by Cobbett, who moved a much more extreme one over his head
and carried it by an immense majority. It was a brutal time, and there
cannot be a doubt but that Alderman Thurtell, while busy setting the
world straight, failed to bring up his family very well. John, as we
shall see, was hanged; Thomas, another brother, was associated with him
in many disgraceful transactions; while a third brother, George, also a
subscriber, by the way, to Borrow's <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, who was a
landscape gardener at Eaton, died in prison in 1848 under sentence for
theft. Apart from a rather riotous and bad bringing up, which may be
pleaded in extenuation, it is not possible to waste much sympathy over
John Thurtell. He had thoroughly disgraced himself in Norwich before he
removed to London. There he got further and further into difficulties,
and one of the many publications which arose out of his trial and
execution was devoted to pointing the moral of the evils of
gambling.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It was bad luck at cards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> and the loss of much money to
William Weare, who seems to have been an exceedingly vile person, that
led to the murder. Thurtell had a friend named Probert who lived in a
quiet cottage in a byway of Hertfordshire&mdash;Gill's Hill, near Elstree. He
suggested to Weare in a friendly way that they should go for a day's
shooting at Gill's Hill, and that Probert would put them up for the
night. Weare went home, collected a few things in a bag, and took a
hackney coach to a given spot, where Thurtell met him with a gig. The
two men drove out of London together. The date was 24th October 1823. On
the high-road they met and passed Probert and a companion named Joseph
Hunt, who had even been instructed by Thurtell to bring a sack with
him&mdash;this was actually used to carry away the body&mdash;and must therefore
have been privy to the intended murder. By the time the second gig
containing Probert and Hunt arrived near Probert's cottage, Thurtell met
it in the roadway, according to their accounts, and told the two men
that he had done the deed; that he had killed Weare first by
ineffectively shooting him, then by dashing out his brains with his
pistol, and finally by cutting his throat. Thurtell further told his
friends, if their evidence was to be trusted, that he had left the body
behind a hedge. In the night the three men placed the body in a sack and
carried it to a pond near Probert's house and threw it in. The next
night they fished it out and threw it into another pond some distance
away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurtell meanwhile had divided the spoil&mdash;some &pound;20, which he said was
all that he had obtained from Weare's body&mdash;with his companions. Hunt,
it may be mentioned, afterwards declared his conviction that Thurtell,
when he first committed the murder, had removed his victim's principal
treasure, notes to the value of three or four hundred pounds. Suspicion
was aroused, and the hue and cry raised through the finding by a
labourer of the pistol in the hedge, and the discovery of a pool of
blood on the roadway. Probert promptly turned informer; Hunt also tried
to save himself by a rambling confession, and it was he who revealed
where the body was concealed, accompanying the officers to the pond and
pointing out the exact spot where the corpse would be found. When
recovered the body was taken to the Artichoke Inn at Elstree, and here
the coroner's inquest was held. Meanwhile Thurtell had been arrested in
London, and taken down to Elstree to be present at the inquest. A
verdict of guilty against all three miscreants was given by the
coroner's jury, and Weare's body was buried in Elstree Churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>In January 1824 John Thurtell was brought to trial at Hertford Assizes,
and Hunt also. But first of all there were some interesting proceedings
in the Court of King's Bench, before the Chief Justice and two other
judges,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> complaining that Thurtell had not been allowed to see his
counsel. And there were other points at issue. Thurtell's counsel moved
for a criminal injunction against the proprietor of the Surrey Theatre
in that a performance had been held there, and was being held, which
assumed Thurtell's guilt, the identical horse and gig being exhibited in
which Weare was supposed to have ridden to the scene of his death.
Finally this was arranged, and a <i>mandamus</i> was granted 'commanding the
admission of legal advisers to the prisoner.' At last the trial came on
at Hertford before Mr. Justice Park. It lasted two days, although the
judge wished to go on all night in order to finish in one. But the
protest of Thurtell, supported by the jury, led to an adjournment.
Probert had been set free and appeared as a witness. The jury gave a
verdict of guilty, and Thurtell and Hunt were sentenced to be hanged,
but Hunt escaped with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> transportation. Thurtell made his own speech for
the defence, which had a great effect upon the jury, until the judge
swept most of its sophistries away. It was, however, a very able
performance. Thurtell's line of defence was to declare that Hunt and
Probert were the murderers, and that he was a victim of their perjuries.
If hanged, he would be hanged on circumstantial evidence only, and he
gave, with great elaboration, the details of a number of cases where men
had been wrongfully hanged upon circumstantial evidence. His lawyers had
apparently provided him with books containing these examples from the
past, and his month in prison was devoted to this defence, which showed
great ability. The trial took place on 6th January 1824, and Thurtell
was hanged on the 9th, in front of Hertford Gaol: his body was given to
the Anatomical Museum in London. A contemporary report says that
Thurtell, on the scaffold,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>fixed his eyes on a young gentleman in the crowd, whom he had
frequently seen as a spectator at the commencement of the
proceedings against him. Seeing that the individual was
affected by the circumstances, he removed them to another
quarter, and in so doing recognised an individual well known in
the sporting circles, to whom he made a slight bow.</p></div>

<p>The reader of <i>Lavengro</i> might speculate whether that 'young gentleman'
was Borrow, but Borrow was in Norwich in January 1824, his father dying
in the following month. In his <i>Celebrated Trials</i> Borrow tells the
story of the execution with wonderful vividness, and supplies effective
quotations from 'an eyewitness.' Borrow no doubt exaggerated his
acquaintance with Thurtell, as in his <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> romance he was
fully entitled to do for effect. He was too young at the time to have
been much noticed by a man so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> his senior. The writer who accepts
Borrow's own statement that he really gave him 'some lessons in the
noble art' is too credulous,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and the statement that Thurtell's house
'on the Ipswich Road was a favourite rendezvous for the Fancy' is
unsupported by evidence. Old Alderman Thurtell owned the house in
question, and we find no evidence that he encouraged his son's
predilection for prize-fighting. In <i>The Romany Rye</i> he gives his friend
the jockey as his authority for the following apologia:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The night before the day he was hanged at H&mdash;&mdash;, I harnessed a
Suffolk Punch to my light gig, the same Punch which I had
offered to him, which I have ever since kept, and which brought
me and this short young man to Horncastle, and in eleven hours
I drove that Punch one hundred and ten miles. I arrived at
H&mdash;&mdash; just in the nick of time. There was the ugly jail&mdash;the
scaffold&mdash;and there upon it stood the only friend I ever had in
the world. Driving my Punch, which was all in a foam, into the
midst of the crowd, which made way for me as if it knew what I
came for, I stood up in my gig, took off my hat, and shouted,
'God Almighty bless you, Jack!' The dying man turned his pale
grim face towards me&mdash;for his face was always somewhat grim, do
you see&mdash;nodded and said, or I thought I heard him say, 'All
right, old chap.' The next moment&mdash;my eyes water. He had a high
heart, got into a scrape whilst in the marines, lost his
half-pay, took to the turf, ring, gambling, and at last cut the
throat of a villain who had robbed him of nearly all he had.
But he had good qualities, and I know for certain that he never
did half the bad things laid to his charge.</p></div>

Borrow had doubtless been appealing for subscribers for a very long
time. I cannot, however, accept Mr. Rye's suggestion to me that Borrow
left Norwich because he was mixed up with Thurtell in ultra-Whig or
Radical scrapes, the intimidation and 'cooping' of Tory voters being a
characteristic of the elections of that day with the wilder spirits, of
whom Thurtell was doubtless one. Borrow's sympathies were with the Tory
party from his childhood up&mdash;following his father.</p></div>

case, for Martha Reay, the mistress of John Montagu, fourth Earl of
Sandwich, was buried in the church in 1779. She was the mother of
several of the Earl's children, one of whom was Basil Montagu. She was a
beautiful woman and a delightful singer, and was appearing on the stage
at Covent Garden, which theatre she was leaving on the night of 7th
April 1779, when the Reverend James Hackman, Vicar of Wiveton in
Norfolk, shot her through the head with a pistol in a fit of jealous
rage. Hackman was hanged at Tyburn, Boswell attending the funeral.
Croft's supposed letters between Hackman and Martha Reay, which made a
great sensation when issued under the title of <i>Love and Madness</i>, are
now known to be spurious (see ch. x. p. 115). Martha Reay was buried in
the chancel of Elstree Church, but Lord Sandwich, who, although he sent
word to Hackman, who asked his forgiveness, that 'he had robbed him of
all comfort in this world,' took no pains to erect a monument over her
remains. On 28th February 1913 the present writer visited Elstree in the
interest of this book. He found that the church of Martha Reay and
William Weare had long disappeared. A new structure dating from 1853 had
taken its place. The present vicar, he was told, has located the spot
where Weare was buried, and it coincides with the old engravings. Martha
Reay's remains, at the time of the rebuilding, were removed to the
churchyard, and lie near the door of the vestry, lacking all memorial.
The Artichoke Inn has also been rebuilt, and 'Weare's Pond,' which alone
recalls the tragedy to-day, where the body was found, has contracted
into a small pool. It is, however, clearly authentic, the brook, as
pictured in the old trial-books, now running under the road.</p></div>

<h3>BORROW AND THE FANCY</h3>


<p>George Borrow had no sympathy with Thurtell the gambler. I can find no
evidence in his career of any taste for games of hazard or indeed for
games of any kind, although we recall that as a mere child he was able
to barter a pack of cards for the Irish language. But he had certainly
very considerable sympathy with the notorious criminal as a friend and
patron of prize-fighting. This now discredited pastime Borrow ever
counted a virtue. Was not his God-fearing father a champion in his way,
or, at least, had he not in open fight beaten the champion of the
moment, Big Ben Brain? Moreover, who was there in those days with blood
in his veins who did not count the cultivation of the Fancy as the
noblest and most manly of pursuits! Why, William Hazlitt, a prince among
English essayists, whose writings are a beloved classic in our day,
wrote in <i>The New Monthly Magazine</i> in these very years<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> his own
eloquent impression, and even introduces John Thurtell more than once as
'Tom Turtle,' little thinking then of the fate that was so soon to
overtake him. What could be more lyrical than this:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Reader, have you ever seen a fight? If not, you have a pleasure
to come, at least if it is a fight like that between the
Gas-man and Bill Neate.</p></div>

<p>And then the best historian of prize-fighting, Henry Downes Miles, the
author of <i>Pugilistica</i>, has his own statement of the case. You will
find it in his monograph on John Jackson, the pugilist who taught Lord
Byron to box, and received the immortality of an eulogistic footnote in
<i>Don Juan</i>. Here is Miles's defence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No small portion of the public has taken it for granted that
pugilism and blackguardism are synonymous. It is as an antidote
to these slanderers that we pen a candid history of the boxers;
and taking the general habits of men of humble origin (elevated
by their courage and bodily gifts to be the associates of those
more fortunate in worldly position), we fearlessly maintain
that the best of our boxers present as good samples of honesty,
generosity of spirit, goodness of heart and humanity, as an
equal number of men of any class of society.</p></div>

<p>From Samuel Johnson to George Bernard Shaw literary England has had a
kindness for the pugilist, although the magistrate has long, and
rightly, ruled him out as impossible. Borrow carried his enthusiasm
further than any, and no account of him that concentrates attention upon
his accomplishment as a distributor of Bibles and ignores his delight in
fisticuffs, has any grasp of the real George Borrow. Indeed it may be
said, and will be shown in the course of our story, that Borrow entered
upon Bible distribution in the spirit of a pugilist rather than that of
an evangelist. But to return to Borrow's pugilistic experiences. He
claims, as we have seen, occasionally to have put on the gloves with
John Thurtell. He describes vividly enough his own conflicts with the
Flaming Tinman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> and with Petulengro. His one heroine, Isopel Berners,
had 'Fair Play and Long Melford' as her ideal, 'Long Melford' being the
good right-handed blow with which Lavengro conquered the Tinman. Isopel,
we remember, had learned in Long Melford Union to 'Fear God and take
your own part!'</p>

<p>George Borrow, indeed, was at home with the whole army of
prize-fighters, who came down to us like the Roman C&aelig;sars or the Kings
of England in a noteworthy procession, their dynasty commencing with
James Fig of Thame, who began to reign in 1719, and closing with Tom
King, who beat Heenan in 1863, or with Jem Mace, who flourished in a
measure until 1872. With what zest must Borrow have followed the account
of the greatest battle of all, that between Heenan and Tom Sayers at
Farnborough in 1860, when it was said that Parliament had been emptied
to patronise a prize-fight; and this although Heenan complained that he
had been chased out of eight counties. For by this time, in spite of
lordly patronage, pugilism was doomed, and the more harmless boxing had
taken its place. 'Pity that corruption should have crept in amongst
them,' sighed Lavengro in a memorable passage, in which he also has his
p&aelig;an of praise for the bruisers of England:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Let no one sneer at the bruisers of England&mdash;what were the
gladiators of Rome, or the bull-fighters of Spain, in its
palmiest days, compared to England's bruisers?<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>Yes: Borrow was never hard on the bruisers of England, and followed
their achievements, it may be said, from his cradle to his grave. His
beloved father had brought him up, so to speak, upon memories of one who
was champion before George was born&mdash;Big Ben Brain of Bristol. Brain,
although always called 'Big Ben,' was only 5 feet 10 in. high. He was
for years a coal porter at a wharf off the Strand. It was in 1791 that
Ben Brain won the championship which placed him upon a pinnacle in the
minds of all robust people. The Duke of Hamilton then backed him against
the then champion, Tom Johnson, for five hundred guineas. 'Public
expectation,' says <i>The Oracle</i>, a contemporary newspaper, 'never was
raised so high by any pugilistic contest; great bets were laid, and it
is estimated &pound;20,000 was wagered on this occasion.' Ben Brain was the
undisputed conqueror, we are told, in eighteen rounds, occupying no more
than twenty-one minutes.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Brain died in 1794, and all the biographers
tell of the piety of his end, so that Borrow's father may have read the
Bible to him in his last moments, as Borrow avers,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but I very much
doubt the accuracy of the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Honour to Brain, who four months after the event which I have
now narrated was champion of England, having conquered the
heroic Johnson. Honour to Brain, who, at the end of other four
months, worn out by the dreadful blows which he had received in
his manly combats, expired in the arms of my father, who read
the Bible to him in his latter moments&mdash;Big Ben Brain.</p></div>

<p>We have already shown that Brain lived for four years after his fight
with Johnson. Perhaps the fight in Hyde Park between Borrow's father and
Ben, as narrated in <i>Lavengro</i>, is all romancing. It makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> good reading
in any case, as does Borrow's eulogy of some of his own contemporaries
of the prize-ring:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>So the bruisers of England are come to be present at the grand
fight speedily coming off; there they are met in the precincts
of the old town, near the field of the chapel, planted with
tender saplings at the restoration of sporting Charles, which
are now become venerable elms as high as many a steeple. There
they are met at a fitting rendezvous, where a retired coachman,
with one leg, keeps an hotel and a bowling-green. I think I now
see them upon the bowling-green, the men of renown, amidst
hundreds of people with no renown at all, who gaze upon them
with timid wonder. Fame, after all, is a glorious thing, though
it lasts only for a day. There's Cribb, the champion of
England, and perhaps the best man in England; there he is, with
his huge, massive figure, and face wonderfully like that of a
lion. There is Belcher, the younger, not the mighty one, who is
gone to his place, but the Teucer Belcher, the most scientific
pugilist that ever entered a ring, only wanting strength to be,
I won't say what. He appears to walk before me now, as he did
that evening, with his white hat, white greatcoat, thin genteel
figure, springy step, and keen, determined eye. Crosses him,
what a contrast! grim, savage Shelton, who has a civil word for
nobody, and a hard blow for anybody&mdash;hard! one blow, given with
the proper play of his athletic arm, will unsense a giant.
Yonder individual, who strolls about with his hands behind him,
supporting his brown coat lappets, under-sized, and who looks
anything but what he is, is the king of the light weights, so
called&mdash;Randall! the terrible Randall, who has Irish blood in
his veins&mdash;not the better for that, nor the worse; and not far
from him is his last antagonist, Ned Turner, who, though beaten
by him, still thinks himself as good a man, in which he is,
perhaps, right, for it was a near thing; and 'a better
shentleman,' in which he is quite right, for he is a Welshman.
But how shall I name them all? They were there by dozens, and
all tremendous in their way. There was Bulldog Hudson, and
fearless Scroggins, who beat the conqueror of Sam the Jew.
There was Black Richmond&mdash;no, he was not there, but I knew him
well; he was the most dangerous of blacks, even with a broken
thigh. There was Purcell, who could never conquer till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> all
seemed over with him. There was&mdash;what! shall I name thee last?
ay, why not? I believe that thou art the last of all that
strong family still above the sod, where mayest thou long
continue&mdash;true piece of English stuff, Tom of Bedford&mdash;sharp as
winter, kind as spring.</p></div>

<p>All this is very accurate history. We know that there really was this
wonderful gathering of the bruisers of England assembled in the
neighbourhood of Norwich in July 1820, that is to say, sixteen miles
away at North Walsham. More than 25,000 men, it is estimated, gathered
to see Edward Painter of Norwich fight Tom Oliver of London for a purse
of a hundred guineas. There were three Belchers, heroes of the
prize-ring, but Borrow here refers to Tom, whose younger brother, Jem,
had died in 1811 at the age of thirty. Tom Belcher died in 1854 at the
age of seventy-one. Thomas Cribb was champion of England from 1805 to
1820. One of Cribb's greatest fights was with Jem Belcher in 1807, when,
in the forty-first and last round, as we are told by the chroniclers,
'Cribb proving the stronger man put in two weak blows, when Belcher,
quite exhausted, fell upon the ropes and gave up the combat.' Cribb had
a prolonged career of glory, but he died in poverty in 1848. Happier was
an earlier champion, John Gully, who held the glorious honour for three
years&mdash;from 1805 to 1808. Gully turned tavern-keeper, and making a
fortune out of sundry speculations, entered Parliament as member for
Pontefract, and lived to be eighty years of age.</p>

<p>It is necessary to dwell upon Borrow as the friend of prize-fighters,
because no one understands Borrow who does not realise that his real
interests were not in literature but in action. He would have liked to
join the army but could not obtain a commission. And so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> he had to be
content with such fighting as was possible. He cared more for the men
who could use their fists than for those who could but wield the pen. He
would, we may be sure, have rejoiced to know that many more have visited
the tomb of Tom Sayers in Highgate Cemetery than have visited the tomb
of George Eliot in the same burial-ground. A curious moral obliquity
this, you may say. But to recognise it is to understand one side of
Borrow, and an interesting side withal.</p>

<h3>EIGHT YEARS OF VAGABONDAGE</h3>


<p>There has been much nonsense written concerning what has been called the
'veiled period' of George Borrow's life. This has arisen from a letter
which Richard Ford of the <i>Handbook for Travellers in Spain</i> wrote to
Borrow after a visit to him at Oulton in 1844. Borrow was full of his
projected <i>Lavengro</i>, the idea of which he outlined to his friends. He
was a genial man in those days, on the wave of a popular success. Was
not <i>The Bible in Spain</i> passing merrily from edition to edition!
Borrow, it is clear, told Ford that he was writing his
'Autobiography'&mdash;he had no misgiving then as to what he should call
it&mdash;and he evidently proposed to end it in 1825 and not in 1833, when
the Bible Society gave him his real chance in life. Ford begged him, in
letters that came into Dr. Knapp's possession, and from which he quotes
all too meagrely, not to 'drop a curtain' over the eight years
succeeding 1825. 'No doubt,' says Ford, 'it will excite a mysterious
interest,' but then he adds in effect it will lead to a wrong
construction being put upon the omission. Well, there can be but one
interpretation, and that not an unnatural one. Borrow had a very rough
time during these eight years. His vanity was hurt, and no wonder. It
seems a small matter to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> now that Charles Dickens should have been
ashamed of the blacking-bottle episode of his boyhood. Genius has a
right to a penurious, and even to a sordid, boyhood. But genius has no
right to a sordid manhood, and here was George 'Olaus' Borrow, who was
able to claim the friendship of William Taylor, the German scholar; who
was able to boast of his association with sound scholastic foundations,
with the High School at Edinburgh and the Grammar School at Norwich; who
was a great linguist and had made rare translations from the poetry of
many nations, starving in the byways of England and of France. What a
fate for such a man that he should have been so unhappy for eight years;
should have led the most penurious of roving lives, and almost certainly
have been in prison as a common tramp.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It was all very well to
romance about a poverty-stricken youth. But when youth had fled there
ceased to be romance, and only sordidness was forthcoming. From his
twenty-third to his thirty-first year George Borrow was engaged in a
hopeless quest for the means of making a living. There is, however, very
little mystery. Many incidents of each of these years are revealed at
one or other point. His home, to which he returned from time to time,
was with his mother at the cottage in Willow Lane, Norwich. Whether he
made sufficient profit out of a horse, as in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, to enable
him to travel upon the proceeds, as Dr. Knapp thinks, we cannot say. Dr.
Knapp is doubtless right in assuming that during this period he led 'a
life of roving adventure,' his own authorised version of his career at
the time, as we have quoted from the biography in his handwriting from
<i>Men of the Time</i>. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> how far this roving was confined to England, how
far it extended to other lands, we do not know. We are, however,
satisfied that he starved through it all, that he rarely had a penny in
his pocket. At a later date he gave it to be understood at times that he
had visited the East, and that India had revealed her glories to him. We
do not believe it. Defoe was Borrow's master in literature, and he
shared Defoe's right to lie magnificently on occasion. Dr. Knapp has
collected the various occasions upon which Borrow referred to his
supposed earlier travels abroad prior to his visit to St. Petersburg in
1833. The only quotation that carries conviction is an extract from a
letter to his mother from St. Petersburg, where he writes of 'London,
Paris, Madrid, and other capitals which I have visited.' I am not,
however, disinclined to accept Dr. Knapp's theory that in 1826-7 Borrow
did travel to Paris and through certain parts of Southern Europe. It is
strange, all the same, that adventures which, had they taken place,
would have provoked a thousand observations, provoked but two or three
passing references. Yet there is no getting over that letter to his
mother, nor that reference in <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>, where he
says&mdash;'Once in the south of France, when I was weary, hungry, and
penniless....' Borrow certainly did some travel in these years, but it
was sordid, lacking in all dignity&mdash;never afterwards to be recalled. For
the most part, however, he was in England. We know that Borrow was in
Norwich in 1826, for we have seen him superintending the publication of
the <i>Romantic Ballads</i> by subscription in that year. In that year also
he wrote the letter to Haydon, the painter, to say that he was ready to
sit for him, but that he was 'going to the south of France in a little
better than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> fortnight.'<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> We know also that he was in Norwich in
1827, because it was then, and not in 1818 as described in <i>Lavengro</i>,
that he 'doffed his hat' to the famous trotting stallion Marshland
Shales, when that famous old horse was exhibited at Tombland Fair on the
Castle Hill. We meet him next as the friend of Dr. Bowring. The letters
to Bowring we must leave to another chapter, but they commence in 1829
and continue through 1830 and 1831. Through them all Borrow shows
himself alive to the necessity of obtaining an appointment of some kind,
and meanwhile he is hard at work upon his translations from various
languages, which, in conjunction with Dr. Bowring, he is to issue as
<i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>. Dr. Knapp thinks that in 1829 he made the
translation of the <i>Memoirs of Vidocq</i>, which appeared in that year with
a short preface by the translator.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> But these little volumes bear no
internal evidence of Borrow's style, and there is no external evidence
to support the assumption that he had a hand in their publication. His
occasional references to Vidocq are probably due to the fact that he had
read this little book.</p>

<p>I have before me one very lengthy manuscript of Borrow's of this period.
It is dated December 1829,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> and is addressed, 'To the Committee of the
Honourable and Praiseworthy Association, known by the name of the
Highland Society.'<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It is a proposal that they should publish in two
thick octavo volumes a series of translations of the best and most
approved poetry of the ancient and modern Scots-Gaelic bards. Borrow was
willing to give two years to the project, for which he pleads 'with no
sordid motive.' It is a dignified letter, which will be found in one of
Dr. Knapp's appendices&mdash;so presumably Borrow made two copies of it. The
offer was in any case declined, and so Borrow passed from disappointment
to disappointment during these eight years, which no wonder he desired,
in the coming years of fame and prosperity, to veil as much as possible.
The lean years in the lives of any of us are not those upon which we
delight to dwell, or upon which we most cheerfully look back.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>SIR JOHN BOWRING</h3>


<p>'Poor George.... I wish he were making money. He works hard and remains
poor'&mdash;thus wrote John Borrow to his mother in 1830 from Mexico, and it
disposes in a measure of any suggestion of mystery with regard to five
of those years that he wished to veil. They were not spent, it is clear,
in rambling in the East, as he tried to persuade Colonel Napier many
years later. They were spent for the most part in diligent attempt at
the capture of words, in reading the poetry and the prose of many lands,
and in making translations of unequal merit from these diverse tongues.
This is indisputably brought home to me by the manuscripts in my
possession, supplemented by those that fell to Dr. Knapp. These
manuscripts represent years of work. Borrow has been counted a
considerable linguist, and he had assuredly a reading and speaking
acquaintance with a great many languages. But this knowledge was
acquired, as all knowledge is, with infinite trouble and patience. I
have before me hundreds of small sheets of paper upon which are written
English words and their equivalents in some twenty or thirty languages.
These serve to show that Borrow learnt a language as a small boy in an
old-fashioned system of education learns his Latin or French&mdash;by writing
down simple words&mdash;'father,' 'mother,' 'horse,' 'dog,' and so on with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the same word in Latin or French in front of them. Of course Borrow had
a superb memory and abundant enthusiasm, and so he was enabled to add
one language to another and to make his translations from such books as
he could obtain, with varied success. I believe that nearly all the
books that he handled came from the Norwich library, and when Mrs.
Borrow wrote to her elder son to say that George was working hard, as we
may fairly assume, from the reply quoted, that she did, she was
recalling this laborious work at translation that must have gone on for
years. We have seen the first fruit in the translation from the
German&mdash;or possibly from the French&mdash;of Klinger's <i>Faustus</i>; we have
seen it in <i>Romantic Ballads</i> from the Danish, the Irish, and the
Swedish. Now there really seemed a chance of a more prosperous
utilisation of his gift, for Borrow had found a zealous friend who was
prepared to go forward with him in this work of giving to the English
public translations from the literatures of the northern nations. This
friend was Dr. John Bowring, who made a very substantial reputation in
his day.</p>

<p>Bowring has told his own story in a volume of <i>Autobiographical
Recollections</i>,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> a singularly dull book for a man whose career was at
once so varied and so full of interest. He was born at Exeter in 1792 of
an old Devonshire family, and entered a merchant's office in his native
city on leaving school. He early acquired a taste for the study of
languages, and learnt French from a refugee priest precisely in the way
in which Borrow had done. He also acquired Italian, Spanish, German and
Dutch, continuing with a great variety of other languages. Indeed, only
the very year after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> Borrow had published <i>Faustus</i>, he published his
<i>Ancient Poetry and Romances of Spain</i>, and the year after Borrow's
<i>Romantic Ballads</i> came Bowring's <i>Servian Popular Poetry</i>. With such
interest in common it was natural that the two men should be brought
together, but Bowring had the qualities which enabled him to make a
career for himself and Borrow had not. In 1811, as a clerk in a London
mercantile house, he was sent to Spain, and after this his travels were
varied. He was in Russia in 1820, and in 1822 was arrested at Calais and
thrown into prison, being suspected by the Bourbon Government of
abetting the French Liberals. Canning as Foreign Minister took up his
cause, and he was speedily released. He assisted Jeremy Bentham in
founding <i>The Westminster Review</i> in 1824. Meanwhile he was seeking
official employment, and in conjunction with Mr. Villiers, afterwards
Earl of Clarendon, and that ambassador to Spain who befriended Borrow
when he was in the Peninsula, became a commissioner to investigate the
commercial relations between England and France. After the Reform Bill
of 1832 Bowring was frequently a candidate for Parliament, and was
finally elected for Bolton in 1841. In the meantime he assisted Cobden
in the formation of the Anti-Corn Law League in 1838. Having suffered
great monetary losses in the interval, he applied for the appointment of
Consul at Canton, of which place he afterwards became Governor, being
knighted in 1854. At one period of his career at Hong Kong his conduct
was made the subject of a vote of censure in Parliament, Lord
Palmerston, however, warmly defending him. Finally returning to England
in 1862, he continued his literary work with unfailing zest. He died at
Exeter, in a house very near that in which he was born, in 1872. His
extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> energies cannot be too much praised, and there is no
doubt but that in addition to being the possessor of great learning he
was a man of high character. His literary efforts were surprisingly
varied. There are at least thirty-six volumes with his name on the
title-page, most of them unreadable to-day; even such works, for
example, as his <i>Visit to the Philippine Isles</i> and <i>Siam and the
Siamese</i>, which involved travel into then little-known lands. Perhaps
the only book by him that to-day commands attention is his translation
of Chamisso's <i>Peter Schlemihl</i>. The most readable of many books by him
into which I have dipped is his <i>Servian Popular Poetry</i> of 1827, in
which we find interesting stories in verse that remind us of similar
stories from the Danish in Borrow's <i>Romantic Ballads</i> published only
the year before. The extraordinary thing, indeed, is the many points of
likeness between Borrow and Bowring. Both were remarkable linguists;
both had spent some time in Spain and Russia; both had found themselves
in foreign prisons. They were alike associated in some measure with
Norwich&mdash;Bowring through friendship with Taylor&mdash;and I might go on to
many other points of likeness or of contrast. It is natural, therefore,
that the penniless Borrow should have welcomed acquaintance with the
more prosperous scholar. Thus it is that, some thirty years later,
Borrow described the introduction by Taylor:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The writer had just entered into his eighteenth year, when he
met at the table of a certain Anglo-Germanist an individual,
apparently somewhat under thirty, of middle stature, a thin and
weaselly figure, a sallow complexion, a certain obliquity of
vision, and a large pair of spectacles. This person, who had
lately come from abroad, and had published a volume of
translations, had attracted some slight notice in the literary
world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion in a small
provincial capital. After dinner he argued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> a great deal, spoke
vehemently against the Church, and uttered the most desperate
Radicalism that was perhaps ever heard, saying, he hoped that
in a short time there would not be a king or queen in Europe,
and inveighing bitterly against the English aristocracy, and
against the Duke of Wellington in particular, whom he said, if
he himself was ever president of an English republic&mdash;an event
which he seemed to think by no means improbable&mdash;he would hang
for certain infamous acts of profligacy and bloodshed which he
had perpetrated in Spain. Being informed that the writer was
something of a philologist, to which character the individual
in question laid great pretensions, he came and sat down by
him, and talked about languages and literature. The writer, who
was only a boy, was a little frightened at first.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p></div>

<p>The quarrels of authors are frequently amusing but rarely edifying, and
this hatred of Bowring that possessed the soul of poor Borrow in his
later years is of the same texture as the rest. We shall never know the
facts, but the position is comprehensible enough. Let us turn to the
extant correspondence<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> which, as far as we know, opened when Borrow
paid what was probably his third visit to London in 1829:</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I trouble you with these lines for the purpose of
submitting a little project of mine for your approbation. When
I had last the pleasure of being at yours, you mentioned, that
we might at some future period unite our strength in composing
a kind of Danish Anthology. You know, as well as I, that by far
the most remarkable portion of Danish poetry is comprised in
those ancient popular productions termed <i>K&aelig;mpe Viser</i>, which I
have translated. Suppose we bring forward at once the first
volume of the Danish Anthology, which should contain the heroic
and supernatural songs of the <i>K. V.</i>, which are certainly the
most interesting; they are quite ready for the press with the
necessary notes, and with an introduction which I am not
ashamed of. The second volume might consist of the Historic
songs and the ballads and Romances, this and the third volume,
which should consist of the modern Danish poetry, and should
commence with the celebrated 'Ode to the Birds' by Morten
Borup, might appear in company at the beginning of next season.
To &Ouml;lenslager should be allotted the principal part of the
fourth volume; and it is my opinion that amongst his minor
pieces should be given a good translation of his Aladdin, by
which alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> he has rendered his claim to the title of a great
poet indubitable. A proper Danish Anthology cannot be contained
in less than 4 volumes, the literature being so copious. The
first volume, as I said before, might appear instanter, with no
further trouble to yourself than writing, if you should think
fit, a page or two of introductory matter.&mdash;Yours most truly,
my dear Sir,</p></div>

will not be disengaged till next Friday evening (this day week)
I will call then. You think that no more than two volumes can
be ventured on. Well! be it so! The first volume can contain 70
choice <i>K&aelig;mpe Viser</i>; viz. all the heroic, all the supernatural
ballads (which two classes are by far the most interesting),
and a few of the historic and romantic songs. The sooner the
work is advertised the better, <i>for I am terribly afraid of
being forestalled in the K&aelig;mpe Viser by some of those Scotch
blackguards</i> who affect to translate from all languages, of
which they are fully as ignorant as Lockhart is of Spanish. I
am quite ready with the first volume, which might appear by the
middle of February (the best time in the whole season), and if
we unite our strength in the second, I think we can produce
something worthy of fame, for we shall have plenty of matter to
employ talent upon.&mdash;Most truly yours,</p></div>

yesterday from your volume 3 longish <i>K&aelig;mpe Visers</i>, among
which is the 'Death of King Hacon at Kirkwall in Orkney,' after
his unsuccessful invasion of Scotland. To-day I translated 'The
Duke's Daughter of Skage,' a noble ballad of 400 lines. When I
call again I will, with your permission, retake Tullin and
attack <i>The Surveyor</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> Allow me, my dear Sir, to direct your
attention to &Ouml;lenschl&aelig;ger's <i>St. Hems Aftenspil</i>, which is the
last in his Digte of 1803. It contains his best lyrics, one or
two of which I have translated. It might, I think, be contained
within 70 pages, and I could translate it in 3 weeks. Were we
to give the whole of it we should gratify &Ouml;lenschl&aelig;ger's wish
expressed to you, that one of his larger pieces should appear.
But it is for you to decide entirely on what <i>is</i> or what is

feel much obliged if you would speak to him about my reviewing
Tegner, and enquire whether a <i>good</i> article on Welsh poetry
would be received. I have the advantage of not being a
Welshman. I would speak the truth, and would give translations
of some of the best Welsh poetry; and I really believe that my
translations would not be the worst that have been made from
the Welsh tongue.&mdash;Most truly yours,</p></div>

meet Mr. Grundtvig to-morrow morning. As at present no doubt
seems to be entertained of Prince Leopold's accepting the
sovereignty of Greece, would you have any objection to write to
him concerning me? I should be very happy to go to Greece in
his service. I do not wish to go in a civil or domestic
capacity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> and I have, moreover, no doubt that all such
situations have been long since filled up; I wish to go in a
military one, for which I am qualified by birth and early
habits. You might inform the Prince that I have been for years
on the Commander-in-Chief's List for a commission, but that I
have not had sufficient interest to procure an appointment. One
of my reasons for wishing to reside in Greece is, that the
mines of Eastern Literature would be acceptable to me. I should
soon become an adept in Turkish, and would weave and transmit
to you such an anthology as would gladden your very heart. As
for <i>The Songs of Scandinavia</i>, all the ballads would be ready
before departure, and as I should take books, I would in a few
months send you translations of the modern lyric poetry. I hope
this letter will not displease you. I do not write it from
<i>flightiness</i>, but from thoughtfulness. I am uneasy to find
myself at four and twenty drifting on the sea of the world, and
likely to continue so.&mdash;Yours most sincerely,</p></div>

<p>This letter is printed in part by Dr. Knapp, and almost in its entirety
by Mr. Herbert Jenkins. Dr. Knapp has much sound worldly reflection upon
its pathetic reference to 'drifting on the sea of the world.' If only,
he suggests, Borrow had not received that unwise eulogy from Allan
Cunningham about his 'exquisite Danish ballads,' if only he had listened
to Richard Ford's advice&mdash;which came too late in any case&mdash;'Avoid poetry
and translations of poets'&mdash;how much better it would have been. But
Borrow had not the makings in him of a 'successful' man, and we who
enjoy his writings to-day must be contented with the reflection that he
had just the kind of life-experience which gave us what he had to give.
Here Borrow holds his place among the poets&mdash;an unhappy race. In any
case the British Museum appointment was not for him, nor the military
career. Had one or other fallen to his lot, we might have had much
literary work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> of a kind, but certainly not <i>Lavengro</i>. To return to the
correspondence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have looked over Mr. Grundtvig's manuscripts.
It is a very long affair, and the language is Norman-Saxon. &pound;40
would not be an extravagant price for a transcript, and so they
told him at the museum. However, as I am doing nothing
particular at present, and as I might learn something from
transcribing it, I would do it for &pound;20. He will call on you

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I return you my most sincere thanks for your kind
letter of the 2nd inst., and though you have not been
successful in your application to the Belgian authorities in my
behalf, I know full well that you did your utmost, and am only
sorry that at my instigation you attempted an impossibility.
The Belgians seem either not to know or not to care for the
opinion of the great Cyrus, who gives this advice to his
captains: 'Take no heed from what countries ye fill up your
ranks, but seek recruits as ye do horses, not those
particularly who are of your own country, but those of merit.'
The Belgians will only have such recruits as are born in
Belgium, and when we consider the <i>heroic</i> manner in which the
native Belgian army defended the person of their new sovereign
in the last conflict with the Dutch, can we blame them for
their determination? It is rather singular, however, that,
resolved as they are to be served only by themselves, they
should have sent for 50,000 Frenchmen to clear their country of
a handful of Hollanders, who have generally been considered the
most unwarlike people in Europe, but who, if they had had fair
play given them, would long ere this time have replanted the
Orange flag on the towers of Brussels, and made the Belgians
what they deserve to be&mdash;hewers of wood and drawers of water.
And now, my dear Sir, allow me to reply to a very important
part of your letter. You ask me whether I wish to purchase a
commission in the British Service, because in that case you
would speak to the Secretary at War about me. I must inform
you, therefore, that my name has been for several years upon
the list <i>for the purchase</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> of a commission, and I have never
yet had sufficient interest to procure an appointment. If I can
do nothing better I shall be very glad to purchase; but I will
pause two or three months before I call upon you to fulfil your
kind promise. It is believed that the militias will be embodied
in order to be sent to that unhappy country Ireland, and,
provided I can obtain a commission in one of them and they are
kept in service, it would be better than spending &pound;500 upon one
in the line. I am acquainted with the colonels of the two
Norfolk regiments, and I dare say that neither of them would
have any objection to receive me. If they are not embodied I
will most certainly apply to you, and you may say when you
recommend me that, being well grounded in Arabic, and having
some talent for languages, I might be an acquisition to a corps
in one of our Eastern colonies. I flatter myself that I could
do a great deal in the East provided I could once get there,
either in a civil or military capacity. There is much talk at
present about translating European books into the two great
languages, the Arabic and Persian. Now I believe that with my
enthusiasm for those tongues I could, if resident in the East,
become in a year or two better acquainted with them than any
European has been yet, and more capable of executing such a
task. Bear this in mind, and if, before you hear from me again,
you should have any opportunity to recommend me as a proper
person to fill any civil situation in those countries, or to
attend any expedition thither, I pray you to lay hold of it,
and no conduct of mine shall ever give you reason to repent of
it.&mdash;I remain, my dear Sir, your most obliged and obedient
servant,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Present my best remembrances to Mrs. Bowring and to
Edgar, and tell them that they will both be starved. There is
now a report in the street that twelve corn-stacks are blazing
within twenty miles of this place. I have lately been wandering
about Norfolk, and I am sorry to say that the minds of the
peasantry are in a horrible state of excitement. I have
repeatedly heard men and women in the harvest-field swear that
not a grain of the corn they were cutting should be eaten, and
that they would as lieve be hanged as live. I am afraid all
this will end in a famine and a rustic war.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Borrow's next letter to Bowring that has been preserved is dated 1835
and was written from Portugal. With that I will deal when we come to
Borrow's travels in the Peninsula. Here it sufficeth to note that during
the years of Borrow's most urgent need he seems to have found a kind
friend if not a very zealous helper in the 'Old Radical' whom he came to
hate so cordially.</p>

<h3>BORROW AND THE BIBLE SOCIETY</h3>


<p>That George Borrow should have become an agent for the Bible Society,
then in the third decade of its flourishing career, has naturally
excited doubts as to his moral honesty. The position was truly a
contrast to an earlier ideal contained in the letter to his Norwich
friend, Roger Kerrison, that we have already given, in which, with all
the zest of a Shelley, he declares that he intends to live in London,
'write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion, and get myself prosecuted.'
But that was in 1824, and Borrow had suffered great tribulation in the
intervening eight years. He had acquired many languages, wandered far
and written much, all too little of which had found a publisher. There
was plenty of time for his religious outlook to have changed in the
interval, and in any case Borrow was no theologian. The negative outlook
of 'Godless Billy Taylor,' and the positive outlook of certain
Evangelical friends with whom he was now on visiting terms, were of
small account compared with the imperative need of making a living&mdash;and
then there was the passionate longing of his nature for a wider
sphere&mdash;for travelling activity which should not be dependent alone upon
the vagabond's crust. What matter if, as Harriet Martineau&mdash;most
generous and also most malicious of women, with much kinship with Borrow
in temperament&mdash;said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> that his appearance before the public as a devout
agent of the Bible Society excited a 'burst of laughter from all who
remembered the old Norwich days'; what matter if another 'scribbling
woman,' as Carlyle called such strident female writers as were in vogue
in mid-Victorian days&mdash;Frances Power Cobbe&mdash;thought him 'insincere';
these were unable to comprehend the abnormal heart of Borrow, so
entirely at one with Goethe in <i>Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre</i>:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Here was Borrow's opportunity indeed. Verily I believe that it would
have been the same had it been a society for the propagation of the
writings of Defoe among the Persians. With what zest would Borrow have
undertaken to translate <i>Moll Flanders</i> and <i>Captain Singleton</i> into the
languages of Hafiz and Omar! But the Bible Society was ready to his
hand, and Borrow did nothing by halves. A good hater and a staunch
friend, he was loyal to the Bible Society in no half-hearted way, and
not the most pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> quarrel with forces obviously quite out of tune
with his nature led to any real slackening of that loyalty. In the end a
portion of his property went to swell the Bible Society's funds.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>When Borrow became one of its servants, the Bible Society was only in
its third decade. It was founded in the year 1804, and had the names of
William Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, and Zachary Macaulay on its first
committee. To circulate the authorised version of the Bible without note
or comment was the first ideal that these worthy men set before them;
never to the entire satisfaction of the great printing organisations,
which already had a considerable financial interest in such a
circulation. For long years the words 'Sold under cost price' upon the
Bibles of the Society excited mingled feelings among those interested in
the book trade<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. The Society's first idea was limited to Bibles in
the English tongue. This was speedily modified. A Bible Society was set
up in Nuremberg to which money was granted by the parent organisation. A
Bible in the Welsh language was circulated broadcast through the
Principality, and so the movement grew. From the first it had one of its
principal centres in Norwich, where Joseph John Gurney's house was open
to its committee, and at its annual gatherings at Earlham his sister
Elizabeth Fry took a leading part, while Wilberforce, Charles Simeon,
the famous preacher, and Legh Richmond, whose <i>Dairyman's Daughter</i>
Borrow failed to appreciate, were of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> the company. 'Uncles Buxton and
Cunningham are here,' we find one of Joseph John Gurney's daughters
writing in describing a Bible Society gathering. This was John
Cunningham, rector of Harrow, and it was his brother who helped Borrow
to his position in connection with the Society, as we shall see. At the
moment of these early meetings Borrow is but a boy, meeting Joseph
Gurney on the banks of the river near Earlham, and listening to his
discourse upon angling. The work of the Bible Society in Russia may be
said to have commenced when one John Paterson of Glasgow, who had been a
missionary of the Congregational body, went to St. Petersburg during
those critical months of 1812 that Napoleon was marching into Russia.
Paterson indeed, William Canton tells us,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> was 'one of the last to
behold the old Tartar wall and high brick towers' and other splendours
of the Moscow which in a month or two were to be consumed by the flames.
Paterson was back again in St. Petersburg before the French were at the
gates of Moscow, and it is noteworthy that while Moscow was burning and
the Czar was on his way to join his army, this remarkable Scot was
submitting to Prince Galitzin a plan for a Bible Society in St.
Petersburg, and a memorial to the Czar thereon:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The plan and memorial were examined by the Czar on the 18th (of
December); with a stroke of his pen he gave his sanction&mdash;'So
be it, Alexander'; and as he wrote, the last tattered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> remnants
of the Grand Army struggled across the ice of the Niemen.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></div>

<p>The Society was formed in January 1813, and when the Czar returned to
St. Petersburg in 1815, after the shattering of Napoleon's power, he
authorised a new translation of the Bible into modern Russian. From
Russia it was not a far cry, where the spirit of evangelisation held
sway, to Manchuria and to China. To these remote lands the Bible Society
desired to send its literature. In 1822 the gospel of St. Matthew was
printed in St. Petersburg in Manchu. Ten years later the type of the
whole New Testament in that language was lying in the Russian capital.
'All that was required was a Manchu scholar to see the work through the
press'.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Here came the chance for Borrow. At this period there
resided at Oulton Hall, Suffolk, but a few miles from Norwich, a family
of the name of Skepper, Edward and Anne his wife, with their two
children, Breame and Mary. Mary married in 1817 one Henry Clarke, a
lieutenant in the Royal Navy. He died a few months afterwards of
consumption. Of this marriage there was a posthumous child, Henrietta
Mary, born but two months after her father's death. Mary Clarke, as she
now was, threw herself with zest into all the religious enthusiasms of
the locality, and the Rev. Francis Cunningham, Vicar of St. Margaret's,
Lowestoft, was one of her friends. Borrow had met Mary Clarke on one of
his visits to Lowestoft, and she had doubtless been impressed with his
fine presence, to say nothing of the intelligence and varied learning of
the young man. The following note, the first communication<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> I can find
from Borrow to his future wife, indicates how matters stood at the time:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. Clarke</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">St. Giles, Norwich</span>, 22 <i>October 1832.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;According to promise I transmit you a piece of
Oriental writing, namely the tale of Blue Beard, translated
into Turkish by myself. I wish it were in my power to send you
something more worthy of your acceptance, but I hope you will
not disdain the gift, insignificant though it be. Desiring to
be kindly remembered to Mr. and Mrs. Skepper and the remainder
of the family,&mdash;I remain, dear Madam, your most obedient humble
servant,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>That Borrow owed his introduction to Mr. Cunningham to Mrs. Clarke is
clear, although Cunningham, in his letter to the Bible Society urging
the claims of Borrow, refers to the fact that a 'young farmer' in the
neighbourhood had introduced him. This was probably her brother, Breame
Skepper. Dr. Knapp was of the opinion that Joseph John Gurney obtained
Borrow his appointment, but the recently published correspondence of
Borrow with the Bible Society makes it clear that Cunningham wrote&mdash;on
27th December 1832&mdash;recommending Borrow to the secretary, the Rev.
Andrew Brandram. How little he knew of Borrow is indicated by the fact
that he referred to him as 'independent in circumstances.' Brandram told
Caroline Fox many years afterwards that Gurney had effected the
introduction, but this was merely a lapse of memory. In fact we find
Borrow asking to be allowed to meet Gurney before his departure. In any
case he has himself told us, in one of the brief biographies of himself
that he wrote, that he promptly walked to London, covering the whole
distance of 112 miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> in twenty-seven hours, and that his expenses
amounted to 5-1/2d. laid out in a pint of ale, a half-pint of milk, a
roll of bread, and two apples. He reached London in the early morning,
called at the offices of the Bible Society in Earl Street, and was
kindly received by Andrew Brandram and Joseph Jowett, the two
secretaries. He was asked if he would care to learn Manchu, and go to
St. Petersburg. He was given six months for the task, and doubtless also
some money on account. He returned to Norwich more luxuriously&mdash;by mail
coach. In June 1833 we find a letter from Borrow to Jowett, dated from
Willow Lane, Norwich, and commencing, 'I have mastered Manchu, and I
should feel obliged by your informing the committee of the fact, and
also my excellent friend, Mr. Brandram.' A long reply to this by Jowett
is among my Borrow Papers, but the Bible Society clearly kept copies of
its letters, and a portion of this one has been printed.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It shows
that Borrow went through much heart-burning before his destiny was
finally settled. At last he was again invited to London, and found
himself as one of two candidates for the privilege of going to Russia.
The examination consisted of a Manchu hymn, of which Borrow's version
seems to have proved the more acceptable, and he afterwards printed it
in his <i>Targum</i>. Finally, on the 5th of July 1833, Borrow received a
letter from Jowett offering him the appointment, with a salary of &pound;200 a
year and expenses. The letter contained his first lesson in the then
unaccustomed discipline of the Evangelical vocabulary. Borrow had spoken
of the prospect of becoming 'useful to the Deity, to man, and to
himself.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>'Doubtless you meant,' commented Jowett, 'the prospect of glorifying
God,' and Jowett frankly tells him that his tone of confidence in
speaking of himself 'had alarmed some of the excellent members of our
committee.' Borrow adapted himself at once, and is congratulated by

next letter.</p>

<p>By an interesting coincidence there was living in Norwich at the moment
when Borrow was about to leave it, a man who had long identified himself
with good causes in Russia, and had lived in that country for a
considerable period of his life. John Venning<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> was born in Totnes in
1776, and he is buried in the Rosary Cemetery at Norwich, where he died
in 1858, after twenty-eight years' residence in that city. He started
for St. Petersburg four years after John Howard had died, ostensibly on
behalf of the commercial house with which he was associated, but with
the intention of carrying on the work of that great man in prison
reform. Alexander I. was on the throne, and he made Venning his friend,
frequently conversing with him upon religious subjects. He became the
treasurer of a society for the humanising of Russian prisons; but when
Nicholas became Czar in 1825 Venning's work became more difficult,
although the Emperor was sympathetic. Venning returned to England in
1830, and thus opportunely, in 1833, was able to give his
fellow-townsman letters of introduction to Prince Galitzin and other
Russian notables, so that Borrow was able to set forth under the
happiest auspices&mdash;with an entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> change of conditions from those eight
years of semi-starvation that he was now to leave behind him for ever.
Borrow left London for St. Petersburg on 31st July 1833, not forgetting
to pay his mother before he left the &pound;17 he had had to borrow during his
time of stress. Always devoted to his mother, Borrow sent her sums of
money at intervals from the moment the power of earning came to him. We
shall never know, we can only surmise something of the self-sacrificing
devotion of that mother during the years in which Borrow had failed to
find remunerative work. Wherever he wandered there had always been a
home in the Willow Lane cottage. It is probable that much the greater
part of the period of his eight years of penury was spent under her
roof. Yet we may be sure that the good mother never once reproached her
son. She had just that touch of idealism in her character that made for
faith and hope. In any case never more was Borrow to suffer penury, or
to be a burden on his mother. Henceforth she was to be his devoted care
to her dying day.</p>

<h3>ST. PETERSBURG AND JOHN P. HASFELD</h3>


<p>Borrow travelled by way of Hamburg and L&uuml;beck to Travem&uuml;nde, whence he
went by sea to St. Petersburg, where he arrived on the twentieth of
August 1833. He was back in London in September 1835, and thus it will
be seen that he spent two years in Russia. After the hard life he had
led, everything was now rose-coloured. 'Petersburg is the finest city in
the world,' he wrote to Mr. Jowett; 'neither London nor Paris nor any
other European capital which I have visited has sufficient pretensions
to enter into comparison with it in respect to beauty and grandeur.' But
the striking thing about Borrow in these early years was his capacity
for making friends. He had not been a week in St. Petersburg before he
had gained the regard of one, William Glen, who, in 1825, had been
engaged by the Bible Society to translate the Old Testament into
Persian. The clever Scot, of whom Borrow was informed by a competent
judge that he was 'a Persian scholar of the first water,' was probably
too heretical for the Society which recalled him, much to his chagrin.
'He is a very learned man, but of very simple and unassuming manners,'
wrote Borrow to Jowett.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> version of the <i>Psalms</i> appeared in
1830, and of <i>Proverbs</i> in 1831. Thus he was going home in despair, but
seems to have had good talk on the way with Borrow in St. Petersburg. In
1845 his complete Old Testament in Persian appeared in Edinburgh. This
William Glen has been confused with another William Glen, a law student,
who taught Carlyle Greek, but they had nothing in common. Borrow and
Carlyle could not possibly have had friends in common. Borrow was drawn
towards this William Glen by his enthusiasm for the Persian language.
But Glen departed out of his life very quickly. Hasfeld, who entered it
about the same time, was to stay longer. Hasfeld was a Dane, now
thirty-three years of age, who, after a period in the Foreign Office at
Copenhagen, had come to St. Petersburg as an interpreter to the Danish
Legation, but made quite a good income as a professor of European
languages in cadet schools and elsewhere. The English language and
literature would seem to have been his favourite topic. His friendship
for Borrow was a great factor in Borrow's life in Russia and elsewhere.
If Borrow's letters to Hasfeld should ever turn up, they will prove the
best that he wrote. Hasfeld's letters to Borrow were preserved by him.
Three of them are in my possession. Others were secured by Dr. Knapp,
who made far too little use of them. They are all written in Danish on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
foreign notepaper: flowery, grandiloquent productions we may admit, but
if we may judge a man by his correspondents, we have a revelation of a
more human Borrow than the correspondence with the friends at Earl
Street reveals:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, <i>6/18 November 1836.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Much water has run through the Neva since I
last wrote to you, my last letter was dated 5/17th April; the
last letter I received from you was dated Madrid, 23rd May, and
I now see with regret that it is still unanswered; it is,
however, a good thing that I have not written as often to you
as I have thought about you, for otherwise you would have
received a couple of letters daily, because the sun never sets
without you, my lean friend, entering into my imagination. I
received the Spanish letter a day or two before I left for
Stockholm, and it made the journey with me, for it was in my
mind to send you an epistle from Svea's capital, but there were
so many petty hindrances that I was nearly forgetting myself,
let alone correspondence. I lived in Stockholm as if each day
were to be my last, swam in champagne, or rested in girls'
embraces. You doubtless blush for me; you may do so, but don't
think that that conviction will murder my almost shameless
candour, the only virtue which I possess, in a superfluous
degree. In Sweden I tried to be lovable, and succeeded, to the
astonishment of myself and everybody else. I reaped the reward
on the most beautiful lips, which only too often had to
complain that the fascinating Dane was faithless like the foam
of the sea and the ice of spring. Every wrinkle which
seriousness had impressed on my face vanished in joy and
smiles; my frozen heart melted and pulsed with the rapid beat
of gladness; in short, I was not recognisable. Now I have come
back to my old wrinkles, and make sacrifice again on the altar
of friendship, and when the incense, this letter, reaches you,
then prove to me your pleasure, wherever you may be, and let an
echo of friendship's voice resound from Granada's Alhambra or
Sahara's deserts. But I know that you, good soul, will write
and give me great pleasure by informing me that you are happy
and well; when I get a letter from you my heart rejoices, and I
feel as if I were happy, and that is what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> happiness consists
of. Therefore, let your soldierlike letters march promptly to
their place of arms&mdash;paper&mdash;and move in close columns to St.
Petersburg, where they will find warm winter quarters. I have
received a letter from my correspondent in London, Mr. Edward
Thomas Allan, No. 11 North Audley St.; he informs me that my
manuscript has been promenading about, calling on publishers
without having been well received; some of them would not even
look at it, because it smelt of Russian leather; others kept it
for three or six weeks and sent it back with 'Thanks for the
loan.' They probably used it to get rid of the moth out of
their old clothes. It first went to Longman and Co.'s,
Paternoster Row; Bull of Hollis St.; Saunders and Otley,
Conduit St.; John Murray of Albemarle St., who kept it for
three weeks; and finally it went to Bentley of New Burlington
St., who kept it for SIX weeks and returned it; now it is to
pay a visit to a Mr. Colburn, and if he won't have the
abandoned child, I will myself care for it. If this finds you
in London, which is quite possible, see whether you can do
anything for me in this matter. Thank God, I shall not buy
bread with the shillings I perhaps may get for a work which has
cost me seventy nights, for I cannot work during the day. In

are referred to; in the same paper you will also find an
extract from my translation. I hope that article will meet with
your approbation. Ivan Semionewitch sends his kind regards to
you. I dare not write any more, for then I should make the
letter a double one, and it may perhaps go after you to the
continent; if it reaches you in England, write AT ONCE to your
sincere friend,</p></div>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I do not know how I shall begin, for you have
been a long time without any news from me, and the fault is
mine, for the last letter was from you; as a matter of fact, I
did produce a long letter for you last year in September, but
you did not get it, because it was too long to send by post and
I had no other opportunity, so that, as I am almost tired of
the letter, you shall, nevertheless, get it one day, for
perhaps you will find something interesting in it; I cannot do
so, for I never like to read over my own letters. Six days ago
I commenced my old hermit life; my sisters left on the 3rd/15th
July, and are now, with God's help, in Denmark. They left with
the French steamer <i>Amsterdam</i>, and had two Russian ladies with
them, who are to spend a few months with us and visit the sea
watering-places. These ladies are the Misses Koladkin, and have
learnt English from me, and became my sisters' friends as soon
as they could understand each other. My sisters have also made
such good progress in your language that they would be able to
arouse your astonishment. They read and understand everything
in English, and thank you very much for the pleasure you gave
them with your 'Targum'; they know how to appreciate 'King
Christian stood by the high mast,' and everything which you
have translated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> of languages with which they are acquainted.
They have not had more than sixty real lessons in English.
After they had taken ten lessons, I began, to their great
despair, to speak English, and only gave them a Danish
translation when it was absolutely necessary. The result was
that they became so accustomed to English that it scarcely ever
occurs to them to speak Danish together; when one cannot get
away from me one must learn from me. The brothers and sisters
remaining behind are now also to go to school when they get
home, for they have recognised how pleasant it is to speak a
language which servants and those around one do not understand.
During all the winter my dearest thought was how, this summer,
I was going to visit my long, good friend, who was previously
lean and who is now fat, and how I should let him fatten me a
little, so as to be able to withstand better the long winter in
Russia; I would then in the autumn, like the bears, go into my
winter lair fat and sleek, and of all these romantic thoughts
none has materialised, but I have always had the joy of
thinking them and of continuing them; I can feel that I smile
when such ideas run through my mind. I am convinced that if I
had nothing else to do than to employ my mind with pleasant
thoughts, I should become fat on thoughts alone. The principal
reason why this real pleasure journey had to be postponed, was
that my eldest sister, Hanna, became ill about Easter, and it
was not until the end of June that she was well enough to
travel. I will not speak about the confusion which a sick lady
can cause in a bachelor's house, occasionally I almost lost my
patience. For the amount of roubles which that illness cost I
could very well have travelled to America and back again to St.
Petersburg; I have, however, the consolation in my reasonable
trouble that the money which the doctor and chemist have
received was well spent. The lady got about again after she had
caused me and Augusta just as much pain, if not more, than she
herself suffered. Perhaps you know how amiable people are when
they suffer from liver trouble; I hope you may never get it. I
am not anxious to have it either, for you may do what the devil
you like for such persons, and even then they are not
satisfied. We have had great festivals here by reason of the
Emperor's marriage; I did not move a step to see the pageantry;
moreover, it is difficult to find anything fresh in it which
would afford me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> enjoyment; I have seen illuminations and
fireworks, the only attractive thing there was must have been
the King of Prussia; but as I do not know that good man, I have
not very great interest in him either; nor, so I am told, did
he ask for me, and he went away without troubling himself in
the slightest about me; it was a good thing that I did not
bother him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear friend</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your friendly letter of the 12th
April, and also for the invitation to visit you. I am thinking
of leaving Russia soon, perhaps permanently, for twenty-seven
years are enough of this climate. It is as yet undecided when I
leave, for it depends on business matters which must be
settled, but I hope it will be soon. What I shall do I do not
yet know either, but I shall have enough to live on; perhaps I
shall settle down in Denmark. It is very probable that I shall
come to London in the summer, and then I shall soon be at
Yarmouth with you, my old true friend. It was a good thing that
you at last wrote, for it would have been too bad to extend
your disinclination to write letters even to me. The last
period one stays in a country is strange, and I have many
persons whom I have to separate from. If you want anything done
in Russia, let me know promptly; when I am in movement I will
write, so that you may know where I am, and what has become of
me. I have been ill nearly all the winter, but now feel daily
better, and when I get on the water I shall soon be well. We
have already had hot and thundery weather, but it has now
become cool again. I have already sold the greater part of my
furniture, and am living in furnished apartments which cost me
seventy roubles per month; I shall soon be tired of that. I am
expecting a letter from Denmark which will settle matters, and
then I can get ready and spread my wings to get out into the
world, for this is not the world, but Russia. I see you have
changed houses, for last year you lived at No. 37. With kindest
regards to your dear ones, I am, dear friend, yours sincerely,</p></div>

concerned with Borrow's Bible Society work in Russia, but they are not
inspiring. Borrow's correspondence with Hasfeld, of which Knapp gives us
glimpses, is more bracing, and the two or three letters from that
admirable Dane that are in my collection I am glad to print here.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_101_101" id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> In the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for March 5, 1836, there is a short,
interesting letter, dated from St. Petersburg, signed J. P. H. This was
obviously written by Hasfeld. 'Here your journal is found in every well
furnished library,' he writes, 'and yet not a passing word do you ever
bestow upon us,' and then, to the extent of nearly five columns, he
discourses upon the present state of Russian literature, and has very
much to say about his friend George Borrow:
</p><p>
'Will it be thought ultra-barbarian if I mention that Mr. George Borrow
concluded, in the autumn, the publication of the New Testament in the
Mandchou language? Remember, if you please, that he was sent here for
the express purpose by the British and Foreign Bible Society of London.
The translation was made for the Society by Mr. Lip&oacute;ftsof, a gentleman
in the service of the Russian Department of Foreign Affairs, who has
spent the greater part of an industrious life in Peking and the East. I
can only say that it is a beautiful edition of an Oriental work, that it
is printed with great care on a fine imitation of Chinese paper made on
purpose. At the outset, Mr. Borrow spent weeks and months in the
printing-office to make the compositors acquainted with the intricate
Mandchou types, and that, as for the contents, I am assured by
well-informed persons, that this translation is remarkable for the
correctness and fidelity with which it has been executed.'
</p><p>
Then Hasfeld goes on to describe Borrow's small volume, <i>Targum</i>: 'The
exquisite delicacy with which he has caught and rendered the beauties of
his well-chosen originals,' he says, 'is a proof of his learning and
genius. The work is a pearl in literature, and, like pearls, it derives
value from its scarcity, for the whole edition was limited to about a
hundred copies.' Then Hasfeld gives two poems from the book, which
really justify his eulogy, for the poetic quality of <i>Targum</i> has not
had justice done to it by Borrow's later critics.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_102_102" id="Footnote_102_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_102_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> The name is frequently spelt 'Hasfeldt,' but I have
followed the spelling not only of Hasfeld's signature in his letters in
my possession, but also of the printed addressed envelope which he was
in the habit of forwarding to his friends in his letters.</p></div>

<h3>THE MANCHU BIBLE&mdash;<i>TARGUM</i>&mdash;<i>THE TALISMAN</i></h3>


<p>The Bible Society wanted the Bible to be set up in the Manchu language,
the official language of the Chinese Court and Government. A Russian
scholar named Lip&oacute;ftsof, who had spent twenty years in China, undertook
in 1821 to translate the New Testament into Manchu for &pound;560. Lip&oacute;ftsof
had done his work in 1826, and had sent two manuscript copies to London.
In 1832 the Rev. William Swan of the London Missionary Society in
passing through St. Petersburg discovered a transcript of a large part
of the Old and New Testament in Manchu, made by one Pierot, a French
Jesuit, many years before. This transcript was unavailable, but a second
was soon afterwards forthcoming for free publication if a qualified
Manchu scholar could be found to see it through the Press. Mr. Swan's
communication of these facts to the Bible Society in London gave Borrow
his opportunity. It was his task to find the printers, buy the paper,
and hire the qualified compositors for setting the type. It must be
admitted Borrow worked hard for his &pound;200 a year. First he had to ask the
diplomatists for permission from the Russian Government, not now so
friendly to British Missionary zeal. The Russian Bible Society had been
suppressed in 1826. He succeeded here. Then he had to continue his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
studies in the Manchu language. He had written from Norwich to Mr.
Jowett on 9th June 1833, 'I have mastered Manchu,' but on 20th January
1834 we find him writing to the same correspondent: 'I pay about six
shillings, English, for each lesson, which I grudge not, for the perfect
acquirement of Manchu is one of my most ardent wishes.'<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Then he
found the printers&mdash;a German firm, Schultz and Beneze&mdash;who probably
printed the two little books of Borrow's own for him as a 'make weight.'
He purchased paper for his Manchu translation with an ability that would
have done credit to a modern newspaper manager. Every detail of these
transactions is given in his letters to the Bible Society, and one
cannot but be amused at Borrow's explanation to the Reverend Secretary
of the little subterfuges by which he proposed to 'best' the godless for
the benefit of the godly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Knowing but too well that it is the general opinion of the
people of this country that Englishmen are made of gold, and
that it is only necessary to ask the most extravagant price for
any article in order to obtain it, I told no person, to whom I
applied, who I was, or of what country; and I believe I was
supposed to be a German.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p></div>

<p>Then came the composing or setting up of the type of the book. When
Borrow was called to account by his London employers, who were not sure
whether he was wasting time, he replied: 'I have been working in the
printing-office, as a common compositor, between ten and thirteen hours
every day.' In another letter Borrow records further difficulties with
the printers after the composition had been effected. Several of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> the
working printers, it appears, 'went away in disgust,' Then he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was resolved 'to do or die,' and, instead of distressing and
perplexing the Committee with complaints, to write nothing
until I could write something perfectly satisfactory, as I now
can; and to bring about that result I have spared neither
myself nor my own money. I have toiled in a close
printing-office the whole day, during ninety degrees of heat,
for the purpose of setting an example, and have bribed people
to work whom nothing but bribes would induce so to do. I am
obliged to say all this in self-justification. No member of the
Bible Society would ever have heard a syllable respecting what
I have undergone but for the question, 'What has Mr. Borrow
been about?'<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p></div>

<p>It is not my intention to add materially to the letters of Borrow from
Russia and from Spain that have already been published, although many
are in my possession. They reveal an aspect of the life of Borrow that
has been amply dealt with by other biographers, and it is an aspect that
interests me but little. Here, however, is one hitherto unpublished
letter that throws much light upon Borrow's work at this time:</p>


<h3>To the Rev. Andrew Brandram</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, <i>18th Oct. 1833.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;Supposing that you will not be displeased to
hear how I am proceeding, I have taken the liberty to send a
few lines by a friend<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> who is leaving Russia for England.
Since my arrival in Petersburg I have been occupied eight hours
every day in transcribing a Manchu manuscript of the Old
Testament belonging to Baron Schilling, and I am happy to be
able to say that I have just completed the last of it, the Rev.
Mr. Swan, the Scottish missionary, having before my arrival
copied the previous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> part. Mr. Swan departs to his mission in
Siberia in about two months, during most part of which time I
shall be engaged in collating our transcripts with the
original. It is a great blessing that the Bible Society has now
prepared the whole of the Sacred Scriptures in Manchu, which
will doubtless, when printed, prove of incalculable benefit to
tens of millions who have hitherto been ignorant of the will of
God, putting their trust in idols of wood and stone instead of
in a crucified Saviour. I am sorry to say that this country in
respect to religion is in a state almost as lamentable as the
darkest regions of the East, and the blame of this rests
entirely upon the Greek hierarchy, who discountenance all
attempts to the spiritual improvement of the people, who, poor
things, are exceedingly willing to receive instruction, and,
notwithstanding the scantiness of their means in general for
the most part, eagerly buy the tracts which a few pious English
Christians cause to be printed and hawked in the neighbourhood.
But no one is better aware, Sir, than yourself that without the
Scriptures men can never be brought to a true sense of their
fallen and miserable state, and of the proper means to be
employed to free themselves from the thraldom of Satan. The
last few copies which remained of the New Testament in Russian
were purchased and distributed a few days ago, and it is
lamentable to be compelled to state that at the present there
appears no probability of another edition being permitted in
the modern language. It is true that there are near twenty
thousand copies of the Sclavonic bible in the shop which is
entrusted with the sale of the books of the late Russian Bible
Society, but the Sclavonian translation is upwards of a
thousand years old, having been made in the eighth century, and
differs from the dialect spoken at present in Russia as much as
the old Saxon does from the modern English. Therefore it cannot
be of the slightest utility to any but the learned, that is, to
about ten individuals in one thousand. I hope and trust that
the Almighty will see fit to open some door for the
illumination of this country, for it is not to be wondered if
vice and crime be very prevalent here when the people are
ignorant of the commandments of God. Is it to be wondered that
the people follow their every day pursuits on the Sabbath when
they know not the unlawfulness of so doing? Is it to be
wondered that they steal when only in dread of the laws of the
country, and are not deterred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> by the voice of conscience which
only exists in a few. This accounts for their profanation of
their Sabbath, their proneness to theft, etc. It is only
surprising that so much goodness is to be found in their nature
as is the case, for they are mild, polite, and obliging, and in
most of their faces is an expression of great kindness and
benignity. I find that the slight knowledge which I possess of
the Russian tongue is of the utmost service to me here, for the
common opinion in England that only French and German are
spoken by persons of any respectability in Petersburg is a
great and injurious error. The nobility, it is true, for the
most part speak French when necessity obliges them, that is,
when in company with foreigners who are ignorant of Russian,
but the affairs of most people who arrive in Petersburg do not
lie among the nobility, therefore a knowledge of the language
of the country, unless you associate solely with your own
countrymen, is indispensable. The servants speak no language
but their native tongue, and also nine out of ten of the middle
classes of Russians. I might as well address Mr. Lip&oacute;ftsof, who
is to be my coadjutor in the edition of the New Testament (in
Manchu) in Hebrew as in either French or German, for though he
can read the first a little he cannot speak a word of it or
understand when spoken. I will now conclude by wishing you all
possible happiness. I have the honour to be, etc.,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>When the work was done at so great a cost of money,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and of energy
and enthusiasm on the part of George Borrow, it was found that the books
were useless. Most of these New Testaments were afterwards sent out to
China, and copies distributed by the missionaries there as opportunities
offered. It was found, however, that the Manchus in China were able to
read Chinese, preferring it to their own language, which indeed had
become almost confined to official use.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> 1859 editions
of <i>St. Matthew</i> and <i>St. Mark</i> were published in Manchu and Chinese
side by side, the Manchu text being a reprint of that edited by Borrow,
and these books are still in use in Chinese Turkestan. But Borrow had
here to suffer one of the many disappointments of his life. If not
actually a gypsy he had all a gypsy's love of wandering. No impartial
reader of the innumerable letters of this period can possibly claim that
there was in Borrow any of the proselytising zeal or evangelical fervour
which wins for the names of Henry Martyn and of David Livingstone so
much honour and sympathy even among the least zealous. At the best
Borrow's zeal for religion was of the order of Dr. Keate, the famous
headmaster of Eton&mdash;'Blessed are the pure in heart ... if you are not
pure in heart, by God, I'll flog you!' Borrow had got his New Testaments
printed, and he wanted to distribute them because he wished to see still
more of the world, and had no lack of courage to carry out any well
defined scheme of the organisation which was employing him. Borrow had
thrown out constant hints in his letters home. People had suggested to
him, he said, that he was printing Testaments for which he would never
find readers. If you wish for readers, they had said to him, 'you must
seek them among the natives of Pekin and the fierce hordes of desert
Tartary.' And it was this last most courageous thing that Borrow
proposed. Let him, he said to Mr. Jowett, fix his headquarters at
Kiachta upon the northern frontier of China. The Society should have an
agent there:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am a person of few words, and will therefore state without
circumlocution that I am willing to become that agent. I speak
Russ, Manchu, and the Tartar or broken Turkish of the Russian
steppes, and have also some knowledge of Chinese, which I
might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> easily improve at Kiachta, half of the inhabitants of
which town are Chinamen. I am therefore not altogether
unqualified for such an adventure.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p></div>

<p>The Bible Committee considered this and other plans through the
intervening months, and it seems clear that at the end they would have
sanctioned some form of missionary work for Borrow in the Chinese
Empire; but on 1st June 1835 he wrote to say that the Russian
Government, solicitous of maintaining good relations with China, would
not grant him a passport across Siberia except on the condition that he
carried not one single Manchu Bible thither.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And so Borrow's dreams
were left unfulfilled. He was never to see China or the farther East,
although, because he was a dreamer and like his hero, Defoe, a bit of a
liar, he often said he had. In September 1835 he was back in England
awaiting in his mother's home in Norwich further commissions from his
friends of the Bible Society.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Work on the Manchu New Testament did not entirely absorb Borrow's
activities in St. Petersburg. He seems to have made a proposition to
another organisation, as the following letter indicates. The proposal
does not appear to have borne any fruit:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Prayer Book and Homily Society</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">No. 4 Exeter Hall, London</span>, <i>January 16th, 1835.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letters dated July and November 17, 1834, and
addressed to the Rev. F. Cunningham, have been laid before the
Committee of the Prayer Book and Homily Society, who have
agreed to print the translation of the first three Homilies
into the Russian language at St. Petersburg, under the
direction of Mr. and Mrs. Biller, so soon as they shall have
caused the translation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> to undergo a thorough revision, and
shall have certified the same to this Society. I write by this
post to Mrs. Biller on the subject. In respect to the second
Homily in Manchu, if we rightly understand your statement, an
edition of five hundred copies may be sent forth, the whole
expense of which, including paper and printing, will amount to
about &pound;12. If we are correct in this the Committee are willing
to bear the expense of five hundred copies, by way of trial,
their wish being this, viz.: that printed copies should be put
into the hands of the most competent persons, who shall be
invited to offer such remarks on the translation as shall seem
desirable; especially that Dr. Morrison of Canton should be
requested to submit copies to the inspection of Manchu scholars
as he shall think fit. When the translation has been thoroughly
revised the Committee will consider the propriety of printing a
larger edition. They think that the plan of submitting copies
in letters of gold to the inspection of the highest personages
in China should probably be deferred till the translation has
been thus revised. We hope that this resolution will be
satisfactory to you; but the Committee, not wishing to
prescribe a narrower limit than such as is strictly necessary,
have directed me to say, that should the expense of an edition
of five hundred copies of the Homily in Manchu exceed &pound;12, they
will still be willing to meet it, but not beyond the sum of
&pound;15.</p>

<p>Should you print this edition be pleased to furnish us with
twenty-five copies, and send twenty-five copies at the least to
Rev. Dr. Morrison, at Canton, if you have the means of doing
so; if not, we should wish to receive fifty copies, that <i>we</i>
may send twenty-five to Canton. In this case you will be at
liberty to draw a bill upon us for the money, within the limits
specified above, in such manner as is most convenient. Possibly
Mr. and Mrs. Biller may be able to assist you in this matter.
Believe me, dear Sir, yours most sincerely,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">C. R. Pritchett.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. G. Borrow.</p>

<p>I am not aware whether I am addressing a clergyman or a layman,
and therefore shall direct as above. Will you be so kind as to
send the MS. of the Russian Homilies to Mrs. Biller?</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>During Borrow's last month or two in St. Petersburg he printed two thin
octavo volumes of translations&mdash;some of them verses which, undeterred by
the disheartening reception of earlier efforts, he had continued to make
from each language in succession that he had the happiness to acquire,
although most of the poems are from his old portfolios. These little
books were named <i>Targum</i> and <i>The Talisman</i>. Dr. Knapp calls the latter
an appendix to the former. They are absolutely separate volumes of
verse, and I reproduce their title-pages from the only copies that
Borrow seems to have reserved for himself out of the hundred printed of
each. The publishers, it will be seen, are the German firm that printed
the Manchu New Testament, Schultz and Beneze. Borrow's preface to
<i>Targum</i> is dated 'St. Petersburg, June 1, 1835.' Here in <i>Targum</i> we
find the trial poem which in competition with a rival candidate had won
him the privilege of going to Russia for the Bible Society&mdash;<i>The
Mountain Chase</i>. Here also among new verses are some from the Arabic,
the Persian, and the Turkish. If it be true, as his friend Hasfeld said,
that here was a poet who was able to render another without robbing the
garland of a single leaf&mdash;that would but prove that the poetry which
Borrow rendered was not of the first order. Nor, taking another
standard&mdash;the capacity to render the ballad with a force that captures
'the common people,'&mdash;can we agree with William Bodham Donne, who was
delighted with <i>Targum</i> and said that 'the language and rhythm are
vastly superior to Macaulay's <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>.' In <i>The Talisman</i>
we have four little poems from the Russian of Pushkin followed by
another poem, <i>The Mermaid</i>, by the same author. Three other poems in
Russian and Polish complete the booklet. Borrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> left behind him in St.
Petersburg with his friend, Hasfeld, a presentation copy for Pushkin,
who, when he received it, expressed regret that he had not met his
translator while Borrow was in St. Petersburg.</p>

<h3>THREE VISITS TO SPAIN</h3>


<p>From his journey to Russia Borrow had acquired valuable experience, but
nothing in the way of fame, although his mother had been able to record
in a letter to St. Petersburg that she had heard at a Bible Society
gathering in Norwich his name 'sounded through the hall' by Mr. Joseph
John Gurney and Mr. Cunningham, to her great delight. 'All this is very
pleasing to me,' she said, 'God bless you!' Even more pleasing to Borrow
must have been a letter from Mary Clarke, his future wife, who was able
to tell him that she heard Francis Cunningham refer to him as 'one of
the most extraordinary and interesting individuals of the present day.'
But these tributes were not all-satisfying to an ambitious man, and this
Borrow undoubtedly was. His Russian journey was followed by five weeks
of idleness in Norwich varied by the one excitement of attending a Bible
meeting at Oulton with the Reverend Francis Cunningham in the chair,
when 'Mr. George Borrow from Russia'<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> made one of the usual
conventional missionary speeches, Mary Clarke's brother, Breame Skepper,
being also among the orators. Borrow begged for more work from the
Society. He urged the desirability of carrying out its own idea of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
investigation in Portugal and perhaps also in Spain, and hinted that he
could write a small volume concerning what he saw and heard which might
cover the expense of the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> So much persistency conquered.
Borrow sailed from London on 6th November 1835, and reached Lisbon on
12th November, this his first official visit to the Peninsula lasting
exactly eleven months. The next four years and six months were to be
spent mainly in Spain.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Broadly the time divides itself in the
following fashion:</p>

</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>What a world of adventure do the mere names of these places call up.
Borrow entered the Peninsula at an exciting period of its history.
Traces of the Great War in which Napoleon's legions faced those of
Wellington still abounded. Here and there a bridge had disappeared, and
some of Borrow's strange experiences on ferry-boats were indirectly due
to the results of Napoleon's ambition.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Everywhere there was still
war in the land. Portugal indeed had just passed through a revolution.
The partisans of the infant Queen Maria II. had been fighting with her
uncle Dom Miguel for eight years, and it was only a few short months
before Borrow landed at Lisbon that Maria had become undisputed queen.
Spain, to which Borrow speedily betook himself, was even in a worse
state. She was in the throes of a six years' war. Queen Isabel II., a
child of three, reigned over a chaotic country with her mother Dona
Christina as regent; her uncle Don Carlos was a formidable claimant to
the throne and had the support of the absolutist and clerical parties.
Borrow's political sympathies were always in the direction of
absolutism; but in religion, although a staunch Church of England man,
he was certainly an anti-clerical one in Roman Catholic Spain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> In any
case he steered judiciously enough between contending factions,
describing the fanatics of either side with vigour and sometimes with
humour. Mr. Brandram's injunction to Borrow 'to be on his guard against
becoming too much committed to one particular party' seems to have been
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Borrow's three expeditions to Spain have more to be said for them than
had his journey to St. Petersburg. The work of the Bible Society was and
is at its highest point of human service when distributing either the
Old or the New Testament in Christian countries, Spain, England, or
another. Few there be to-day in any country who, in the interests of
civilisation, would deny to the Bible a wider distribution. In a remote
village of Spain a Bible Society's colporteur, carrying a coloured
banner, sold me a copy of Cipriano de Valera's New Testament for a
peseta. The villages of Spain that Borrow visited could even at that
time compare favourably morally and educationally, with the villages of
his own county of Norfolk at the same period. The morals of the
agricultural labourers of the English fen country eighty years ago were
a scandal, and the peasantry read nothing; more than half of them could
not read. They had not, moreover, the humanising passion for song and
dance that Andalusia knew. But this is not to deny that the Bible
Society under Borrow's instrumentality did a good work in Spain, nor
that they did it on the whole in a broad and generous way. Borrow admits
that there was a section of the Roman Catholic clergy 'favourably
disposed towards the circulation of the Gospel,'<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and the Society
actually fixed upon a Roman Catholic version of the Spanish Bible, that
by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> Scio de San Miguel,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> although this version Borrow considered a
bad translation. Much has been said about the aim of the Bible Society
to provide the Bible without notes or comment&mdash;in its way a most
meritorious aim, although then as now opposed to the instinct of a large
number of the priests of the Roman Church. It is true that their
attitude does not in any way possess the sanction of the ecclesiastical
authorities. It may be urged, indeed, that the interpretation of the
Bible by a priest, usually of mature judgment, and frequently of a
higher education than the people with whom he is associated, is at least
as trustworthy as its interpretation at the hands of very partially
educated young women and exceedingly inadequately equipped young men who
to-day provide interpretation and comment in so many of the Sunday
Schools of Protestant countries.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Behold George Borrow, then, first in Portugal and a little later in
Spain, upon his great mission&mdash;avowedly at first a tentative
mission&mdash;rather to see what were the prospects for Bible distribution
than to distribute Bibles. But Borrow's zeal knew no such limitations.
Before very long he had a shop in one of the principal streets of
Madrid&mdash;the Calle del Principe&mdash;much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> in the heart of things than
the very prosperous Bible Society of our day ventures upon.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Meanwhile he is at present in Portugal not very certain of his
movements, and he writes to his old friend Dr. Bowring the following
letter with a request with which Bowring complied, although in the
coldest manner:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>


<h3>To Dr. John Bowring.</h3>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Pray excuse me for troubling you with these lines. I
write to you, as usual, for assistance in my projects,
convinced that you will withhold none which it may be in your
power to afford, more especially when by so doing you will
perhaps be promoting the happiness of our fellow creatures. I
returned from dear, glorious Russia about three months since,
after having edited there the Manchu New Testament in eight
volumes. I am now in Portugal, for the Society still do me the
honour of employing me. For the last six weeks I have been
wandering amongst the wilds of the Alemtejo and have introduced
myself to its rustics, banditti, etc., and become very popular
amongst them, but as it is much more easy to introduce oneself
to the cottage than the hall (though I am not entirely unknown
in the latter), I want you to give or procure me letters to the
most liberal and influential minds of Portugal. I likewise want
a letter from the Foreign Office to Lord De Walden, in a word,
I want to make what interest I can towards obtaining the
admission of the Gospel of Jesus into the public schools of
Portugal which are about to be established. I beg leave to
state that this is <i>my plan</i>, and not other persons', as I was
merely sent over to Portugal to observe the disposition of the
people, therefore I do not wish to be named as an Agent of the
B.S., but as a person who has plans for the mental improvement
of the Portuguese; should I receive <i>these letters</i> within the
space of six weeks it will be time enough, for before setting
up my machine in Portugal I wish to lay the foundation of
something similar in Spain. When you send the Portuguese
letters direct thus:</p></div>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I start for Spain to-morrow, and I want letters something
similar (there is impudence for you) for Madrid, <i>which I
should like to have as soon as possible</i>. I do not much care at
present for an introduction to the Ambassador at Madrid, as I
shall not commence operations seriously in Spain until I have
disposed of Portugal. I will not apologise for writing to you
in this manner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> for you know me, but I will tell you one
thing, which is that the letter which you procured for me, on
my going to St. Petersburg, from Lord Palmerston, assisted me
wonderfully. I called twice at your domicile on my return; the
first time you were in Scotland, the second in France, and I
assure you I cried with vexation. Remember me to Mrs. Bowring
and God bless you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I am told that Mendiz&aacute;bal is liberal, and has been in
England; perhaps he would assist me.</p></div>

<p>During this eleven months' stay in the Peninsula Borrow made his way to
Madrid, and here he interviewed the British Minister, Sir George
Villiers, afterwards fourth Earl of Clarendon, and had received a quite
remarkable encouragement from him for the publication and distribution
of the Bible. He also interviewed the Spanish Prime Minister,
Mendiz&aacute;bal, 'whom it is as difficult to get nigh as it is to approach
the North Pole,' and he has given us a picturesque account of the
interview in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. It was agreed that 5000 copies of the
Spanish Testament were to be reprinted from Scio's text at the expense
of the Bible Society, and all these Borrow was to handle as he thought
fit. Then Borrow made his way to Granada, where, under date 30th August
1836, his autograph may be read in the visitors' book of the Alhambra:</p>

<p><i>George Borrow Norvicensis.</i></p>

<p>Here he studied his friends the gypsies, now and probably then, as we
may assume from his <i>Zincali</i>, the sordid scum on the hillside of that
great city, but now more assuredly than then unutterably demoralised by
the numerous but curious tourists who visit this rabble under police
protection, the very policeman or gendarme not despising a peseta for
his protective services. But Borrow's hobbies included the Romanies of
every land, and a year later he produced and published<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> a gypsy version
of the Gospel of St. Luke.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In October 1836 Borrow was back in
England. He found that the Bible Society approved of him. In November of
the same year he left London for Cadiz on his second visit to Spain. The
journey is described in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> but here, from my
Borrow Papers, is a kind letter that Mr. Brandram wrote to Borrow's
mother on the occasion:</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I have the joyful news to send you that your
son has again safely arrived at Madrid. His journey we were
aware was exceedingly perilous, more perilous than we should
have allowed him to take had we sooner known the extent of the
danger. He begs me to write, intending to write to you himself
without delay. He has suffered from the intense cold, but
nothing beyond inconvenience. Accept my congratulations, and my
best wishes that your dear son may be preserved to be your
comfort in declining years&mdash;and may the God of all consolation
himself deign to comfort your heart by the truths of that holy

<p>A brilliant letter from Seville followed soon after, and then he went on
to Madrid, not without many adventures. 'The cold nearly killed me,' he
said. 'I swallowed nearly two bottles of brandy; it affected me no more
than warm water.' This to kindly Mr. Brandram, who clearly had no
teetotaller proclivities, for the letter, as he said, 'filled his heart
with joy and gladness.' Meanwhile those five thousand copies of the New
Testament were a-printing, Borrow superintending the work with the
assistance of a new friend, Dr. Us&oacute;z. 'As soon as the book is printed
and issued,' he tells Mr. Brandram, 'I will ride forth from Madrid into
the wildest parts of Spain, ...' and so, after some correspondence with
the Society which is quite entertaining, he did. The reader of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> will note some seventy separate towns and villages that
Borrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> visited, not without countless remarkable adventures on the way.
'I felt some desire,' he says in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, 'to meet with one of
those adventures which upon the roads of England are generally as
plentiful as blackberries in autumn.' Assuredly in this tour of Spanish
villages Borrow met with no lack of adventures. The committee of the
Bible Society authorised this tour in March 1837, and in May Borrow
started off on horseback attended by his faithful servant, Antonio. This
tour was to last five months, and 'if I am spared,' he writes to his
friend Hasfeld, 'and have not fallen a prey to sickness, Carlists,
banditti, or wild beasts, I shall return to Madrid.' He hopes a little
later, he tells Hasfeld, to be sent to China. We have then a glimpse of
his servant, the excellent Antonio, which supplements that contained in
<i>The Bible of Spain</i>. 'He is inordinately given to drink, and is of so
quarrelsome a disposition that he is almost constantly involved in some
broil.'<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Not all his weird experiences were conveyed in his letters
to the Bible Society's secretary. Some of these letters, however&mdash;the
more highly coloured ones&mdash;were used in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, word for
word, and wonderful reading they must have made for the secretary, who
indeed asked for more, although, with a view to keeping Borrow
humble&mdash;an impossible task&mdash;Mr. Brandram takes occasion to say 'Mr.
Graydon's letters, as well as yours, are deeply interesting,' Graydon
being a hated rival, as we shall see. The question of L.S.D. was also
not forgotten by the assiduous secretary. 'I know you are no
accountant,' he writes, 'but do not forget there are some who are,' and
a financial document was forwarded to Borrow about this time which we
reproduce in facsimile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">FACSIMILE OF AN ACCOUNT OF GEORGE BORROW&#39;S EXPENSES IN

</div>

<p>But now Borrow was happy, for next to the adventures of five glorious
months in the villages between Madrid and Coru&ntilde;a nothing could be more
to the taste of Borrow than a good wholesome quarrel. He was imprisoned
by order of the Spanish Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> and released on the intervention of
the British Embassy.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> He tells the story so graphically in <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> that it is superfluous to repeat it; but here he does
not tell of the great quarrel with regard to Lieutenant Graydon that led
him to attack that worthy zealot in a letter to the Bible Society. This
attack did indeed cause the Society to recall Graydon, whose zealous
proclamation of anti-Romanism must however have been more to the taste
of some of its subscribers than Borrow's trimming methods. Moreover,
Graydon worked for love of the cause and required no salary, which must
always have been in his favour. Borrow was ten days in a Madrid prison,
and there, as ever, he had extraordinary adventures if we may believe
his own narrative, but they are much too good to be torn from their
context. Suffice to say here that in the actual correspondence we find
breezy controversy between Borrow and the Society. Borrow thought that
the secretary had called the accuracy of his statements in question as
to this or that particular in his conduct. Ever a fighter, he appealed
to the British Embassy for confirmation of his word, and finally Mr.
Brandram suggested he should come back to England for a time and talk
matters over with the members of the committee. In the beginning of
September 1838 Borrow was again in England, when he issued a lengthy and
eloquent defence of his conduct and a report on 'Past and Future
Operations in Spain.'<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In December of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> the same year Borrow was
again on his way to Cadiz upon his third and last visit to Spain.</p>

<p>Borrow reached Cadiz on this his last visit on 31st December 1838, and
went straight to Seville, where he arrived on 2nd January 1839. Here he
took a beautiful little house, 'a paradise in its way,' in the Plazuela
de la Pila Seca, and furnished it&mdash;clearly at the expense of his friend
Mrs. Clarke of Oulton, who must have sent him a cheque for the purpose.
He had been corresponding regularly with Mrs. Clarke, who had told him
of her difficulties with lawyers and relatives, and Borrow had advised
her to cut the Gordian knot and come to Spain. But Mrs. Clarke and her
daughter, Henrietta, did not arrive from England until June.</p>

<p>In the intervening months Borrow had been working more in his own
interests than in those of the patient Bible Society, for he started to
gather material for his <i>Gypsies of Spain</i>, and this book was for the
most part actually written in Seville. It was at this period that he had
the many interviews with Colonel Elers Napier that we quote at length in
our next chapter.</p>

<p>A little later he is telling Mr. Brandram of his adventure with the
blind girl of Manzanares who could talk in the Latin tongue, which she
had been taught by a Jesuit priest, an episode which he retold in <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>. 'When shall we hear,' he asks, 'of an English rector
instructing a beggar girl in the language of Cicero?' To which Mr.
Brandram, who was rector of Beckenham, replied 'Cui bono?' The letters
of this period are the best that he ever wrote, and are incorporated
more exactly than the earlier ones in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.</p>

<p>Four letters to his mother within the period of his second and third
Spanish visits may well be presented together here from my Borrow
Papers:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. Ann Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Madrid</span>, <i>July 27, 1838.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I am in perfect health though just returned
from a long expedition in which I have been terribly burnt by
the sun. In about ten days I sold nearly a thousand Testaments
among the labourers of the plains and mountains of Castille and
La Mancha. Everybody in Madrid is wondering and saying such a
thing is a miracle, as I have not entered a town, and the
country people are very poor and have never seen or heard of
the Testament before. But I confess to you that I dislike my
situation and begin to think that I have been deceived; the
B.S. have had another person on the sea-coast who has nearly
ruined their cause in Spain by circulating seditious handbills
and tracts. The consequence has been that many of my depots
have been seized in which I kept my Bibles in various parts of
the country, for the government think that he is employed by
me; I told the B.S. all along what would be the consequence of
employing this man, but they took huff and would scarce believe
me, and now all my words are come true; I do not blame the
government in the slightest degree for what they have done in
many points, they have shown themselves to be my good friends,
but they have been driven to the step by the insane conduct of
the person alluded to. I told them frankly in my last letter
that I would leave their service if they encouraged him; for I
will not be put in prison again on his account, and lose
another servant by the gaol fever, and then obtain neither
thanks nor reward. I am going out of town again in a day or
two, but I shall now write very frequently, therefore be not
alarmed for I will run into no danger. Burn this letter and
speak to no one about it, nor any others that I may send. God
bless you, my dear mother.</p></div>

<h3>To Mrs. Ann Borrow, Willow Lane, St. Giles, Norwich (Inglaterra)</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Madrid</span>, <i>August 5, 1838.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I merely write this to inform you that I am
back to Madrid from my expedition. I have been very successful
and have sold a great many Testaments. Indeed all the villages
and towns within thirty miles have been supplied. In Madrid
itself I can do nothing as I am closely watched by order of the
government and not permitted to sell, so that all I do is by
riding out to places where they cannot follow me. I do not
blame them, for they have much to complain of, though nothing
of me, but if the Society will countenance such men as they
have lately done in the South of Spain they must expect to reap
the consequences. It is very probable that I may come to
England in a little time, and then you will see me; but do not
talk any more about yourself being 'no more seen,' for it only
serves to dishearten me, and God knows I have enough to make me
melancholy already. I am in a great hurry and cannot write any
more at present.&mdash;I remain, dear mother, yours affectionately,</p></div>

<h3>To Mrs. Ann Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">(No date.)</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mama</span>,&mdash;As I am afraid that you may not have received my
last letter in consequence of several couriers having been
stopped, I write to inform you that I am quite well.</p>

<p>I have been in some difficulties. I was selling so many
Testaments that the priests became alarmed, and prevailed on
the government to put a stop to my selling any more; they were
likewise talking of prosecuting me as a witch, but they have
thought better of it. I hear it is very cold in England, pray
take care of yourself, I shall send you more in a few
weeks.&mdash;God bless you, my dear mama,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">G. B.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was in the middle of his third and last visit to Spain that Borrow
wrote this next letter to his mother which gives the first suggestion of
the romantic and happy termination of his final visit to the Peninsula:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. Ann Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Seville, Spain</span>, <i>April 27, 1839.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I should have written to you before I left
Madrid, but I had a long and dangerous journey to make, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
wished to get it over before saying anything to you. I am now
safely arrived, by the blessing of God, in Seville, which, in
my opinion, is the most delightful town in the world. If it
were not a strange place with a strange language I know you
would like to live in it, but it is rather too late in the day
for you to learn Spanish and accommodate yourself to Spanish
ways. Before I left Madrid I accomplished a great deal, having
sold upwards of one thousand Testaments and nearly five hundred
Bibles, so that at present very few remain; indeed, not a
single Bible, and I was obliged to send away hundreds of people
who wanted to purchase, but whom I could not supply. All this
has been done without the slightest noise or disturbance or
anything that could give cause of displeasure to the
government, so that I am now on very good terms with the
authorities, though they are perfectly aware of what I am
about. Should the Society think proper to be guided by the
experience which I have acquired, and my knowledge of the
country and the people, they might if they choosed sell at
least twelve thousand Bibles and Testaments yearly in Spain,
but let them adopt or let any other people adopt any other
principle than that on which I act and everything will
miscarry. All the difficulties, as I told my friends the time I
was in England, which I have had to encounter were owing to the
faults and imprudencies of other people, and, I may say, still
are owing. Two Methodist schoolmasters have lately settled at
Cadiz, and some little time ago took it into their heads to
speak and preach, as I am informed, against the Virgin Mary;
information was instantly sent to Madrid, and the blame, or
part of it, was as usual laid to me; however, I found means to
clear myself, for I have powerful friends in Madrid, who are
well acquainted with my views, and who interested themselves
for me, otherwise I should have been sent out of the country,
as I believe the two others have been or will be. I have said
nothing on this point in my letters home, as people would
perhaps say that I was lukewarm, whereas, on the contrary, I
think of nothing but the means best adapted to promote the
cause; but I am not one of those disposed to run a ship on a
rock when only a little skill is necessary to keep her in the
open sea.</p>

<p>I hope Mrs. Clarke will write shortly; tell her if she wishes
for a retreat I have found one here for her and Henrietta. I
have my eye on a beautiful one at fifteen pence a day. I call
it a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> house, though it is a paradise in its way, having a
stable, court-yard, fountain, and twenty rooms. She has only to
write to my address at Madrid and I shall receive the letter
without fail. Henrietta had better bring with her a Spanish
grammar and pocket dictionary, as not a word of English is
spoken here. The house-dog&mdash;perhaps a real English bulldog
would be better&mdash;likewise had better come, as it may be useful.
God bless you therefore for the present, my dearest mother.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>Borrow had need of friends more tolerant of his idiosyncrasies than the
'powerful friends' he describes to his mother, for the Secretary of the
Bible Society was still in a critical mood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You narrate your perilous journey to Seville, and say at the
beginning of the description, 'my usual wonderful good fortune
accompanying us.' This is a mode of speaking to which we are
not accustomed&mdash;it savours, some of our friends would say, a
little of the profane.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p></div>

<p>On 29th July 1839 Borrow was instructed by his Committee to return to
England, but he was already on the way to Tangier, whence in September
he wrote a long and interesting letter to Mr. Brandram, which was
afterwards incorporated in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. He had left Mrs. Clarke
and her daughter in Seville, and they joined him at Gibraltar later. We
find him <i>en route</i> for Tangier, staying two days with Mr. John M.
Brackenbury, the British Consul in Cadiz, who found him a most
fascinating man.</p>

<p>His Tangier life is fully described in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. Here he
picked up a Jewish youth, Hayim Ben Attar, who returned to Spain as his
servant, and afterwards to England.</p>

<p>Borrow, at the end of September, was back again in Seville, in his house
near the cathedral, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> Plazuela de la Pila Seca, which, when I
visited Seville in the spring of this year (1913), I found had long been
destroyed to make way for new buildings. Here he received the following
letter from Mr. George Browne of the Bible Society:&mdash;</p>


<h3>To Mr. Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Bible House</span>, <i>Oct. 7, 1839.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Mr. Brandram and myself being both on the eve
of a long journey, I have only time to inform you that yours of
the 2d ult. from Tangier, and 21st from Cadiz came to hand this
morning. Before this time you have doubtless received Mr.
Brandram's letter, accompanying the resolution of the Comee.,
of which I apprised you, but which was delayed a few days, for
the purpose of reconsideration. We are not able to suggest
precisely the course you should take in regard to the books
left at Madrid and elsewhere, and how far it may be absolutely
necessary or not for you to visit that city again before you
return. The books you speak of, as at Seville, may be sent to
Gibraltar rather than to England, as well as any books you may
deem it expedient or find it necessary to bring out of the
country. As soon as your arrangements are completed we shall
look for the pleasure of seeing you in this country. The haste
in which I am compelled to write allows me to say no more than
that my best wishes attend you, and that I am, with sincere
regard, yours truly,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">G. Browne.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I thank you for your kind remembrance of Mrs. Browne. Did I
thank you for your letter to her? She feels, I assure you, very
much obliged. Your description of Tangier will be another
interesting 'morceau' for her.</p></div>

<p>'Where is Borrow?' asked the Bible Society meanwhile of the Consuls at
Seville and Cadiz, but Borrow had ceased to care. He hoped to become a
successful author with his <i>Gypsies</i>; he would at any rate secure
independence by marriage, which must have been already mooted. In
November he and Mrs. Clarke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> were formally betrothed, and would have
been married in Spain, but a Protestant marriage was impossible there.
When preparing to leave Seville he had one of those fiery quarrels, with
which his life was to be studded. This time it was with an official of
the city over a passport, and the official promptly locked him up, for
thirty hours. Hence the following letter in response to his complaint.
The writer is Mr., afterwards Sir, George Jerningham, then Secretary of
Legation at Madrid, who it may be mentioned came from Costessey, four
miles from Norwich. It is written from the British Legation, and is
dated 23rd December 1839:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two
letters, the one without date, the second dated the <i>19th
November</i> (which however ought to have been <i>December</i>),
respecting the outrageous conduct pursued towards you at
Seville by the Alcalde of the district in which you resided. I
lost no time in addressing a strong representation thereon to
the Spanish Minister, and I have to inform you that he has
acquainted me with his having written to Seville for exact
information upon the whole subject, and that he has promised a
further answer to my representation as soon as his inquiries
shall have been answered. In the meantime I shall not fail to
follow up your case with proper activity.</p></div>

<p>Borrow was still in Seville, hard at work upon the <i>Gypsies</i>, all
through the first three months of the year 1840. In April the three
friends left Cadiz for London. A letter of this period from Mr.
Brackenbury, the British Consul at Cadiz, is made clear by these facts:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">British Consulate, Cadiz</span>, <i>January 27th, 1840.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received on the 19th your very acceptable
letter without date, and am heartily rejoiced to find that you
have received satisfaction for the insult, and that the Alcalde
is likely to be punished for his unjustifiable conduct. If you
come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> Cadiz your baggage may be landed and deposited at the
gates to be shipped with yourselves wherever the steamer may
go, in which case the authorities would not examine it, if you
bring it into Cadiz it would be examined at the gates&mdash;or, if
you were to get it examined at the Custom House at Seville and
there sealed with the seal of the Customs&mdash;it might then be
transhipped into the steamer or into any other vessel without
being subjected to any examination. If you take your horse, the
agents of the steamer ought to be apprized of your intention,
that they may be prepared, which I do not think they generally
are, with a suitable box.</p>

<p>Consuls are not authorised to unite Protestant subjects in the
bonds of Holy Matrimony in popish countries&mdash;which seems a
peculiar hardship, because popish priests could not, if they
would&mdash;hence in Spain no Protestants can be legally married.
Marriages solemnised abroad according to the law of that land
wheresoever the parties may at the time be inhabitants are
valid&mdash;but the law of Spain excludes their priests from
performing these ceremonies where both parties are
Protestants&mdash;and where one is a Papist, except a dispensation
be obtained from the Pope. So you must either go to
Gibraltar&mdash;or wait till you arrive in England. I have
represented the hardship of such a case more than once or twice
to Government. In my report upon the Consular Act, 6 Geo. <span class="smcap">iv.</span>
cap. 87&mdash;eleven years ago&mdash;I suggested that provision should be
made to legalise marriages solemnised by the Consul within the
Consulate, and that such marriages should be registered in the
Consular Office&mdash;and that duly certified copies thereof should
be equivalent to certificates of marriages registered in any
church in England. These suggestions not having been acted
upon, I brought the matter under the consideration of Lord John
Russell (I being then in England at the time of his altering
the Marriage Act), and proposed that Consuls abroad should have
the power of magistrates and civil authorities at home for
receiving the declarations of British subjects who might wish
to enter into the marriage state&mdash;but they feared lest the
introduction of such a clause, simple and efficacious as it
would have been, might have endangered the fate of the Bill;
and so we are as Protestants deprived of all power of being
legally married in Spain.</p>

<p>What sort of a horse is your hack?&mdash;What colour? What age?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Would he carry me?&mdash;What his action? What his price? Because if
in all these points he would suit me, perhaps you would give me
the refusal of him. You will of course enquire whether your
Arab may be legally exported.</p>

<p>All my family beg to be kindly remembered to you.&mdash;I am, my
dear sir, most faithfully yours,</p></div>

account of his health&mdash;partly for literary purposes. I will

office of the Bible Society in October 1835, gave clear indication that
the Society was uncertain how next to utilise Borrow's linguistic and
missionary talents. Should he go to Portugal or to China was the
question. In November the committee had decided on Portugal, although
they thought it probable that Borrow would 'eventually go to China,'
'With Portugal he is already acquainted,' said Mr. Brandram in a letter
of introduction to the Rev. E. Whitely, the British chaplain in Oporto.
So that Borrow must really have wandered into Portugal in that earlier
and more melancholy apprenticeship to vagabondage concerning which there
is so much surmise and so little knowledge. Had he lied about his
acquaintance with Portugal he would certainly have been 'found out' by
this Portuguese acquaintance, with whom he had much social intercourse.</p></div>

insufficient for his account of that period, and I am not of the number,
may turn to the <i>Letters of George Borrow to the Bible Society</i>, from
which we have already quoted, or to Mr. Herbert Jenkins's <i>Life of
George Borrow</i>. In the former book the greater part of 500
closely-printed pages is taken up with repetitions of the story as told
in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, or with additions which Borrow deliberately
cancelled in the work in question. In Mr. Jenkins's <i>Life</i> he will find
that out of a solid volume of 496 pages exactly 212 are occupied with
Borrow's association with the Peninsula and his work therein. To the
enthusiast who desires to supplement <i>The Bible in Spain</i> with valuable
annotation I cordially commend both these volumes.</p></div>

that, if Napoleon had really conquered the Peninsula and had been able

issued in Spanish at Valencia in 1790-93. When in Madrid I picked up on
a second-hand bookstall a copy of a cheap Spanish version of Scio's New
Testament, which bears a much earlier date than the one Borrow carried.
It was published, it will be noted, two years before Borrow published
his translation of Klinger's ribald book <i>Faustus</i>:&mdash;
</p><p>
'El Nuevo Testamento, Traducido al Espa&ntilde;ol de la Vulgata Latina por el
Rmo. P. Philipe Scio de S. Miguel. Paris: En la Imprenta de J. Smith,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_117_117" id="Footnote_117_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> This kind of interpretation is not restricted to the
youthful Sunday School teacher. At a meeting of the Bible Society held
at Norwich&mdash;Borrow's own city&mdash;on 29th May 1913, Mrs. Florence Barclay,
the author of many popular novels, thus addressed the gathering. I quote
from the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i>: 'She had heard sometimes a shallow form
of criticism which said that it was impossible that in actual reality
any man should have lived and breathed three days and three nights in
the interior of a fish. Might she remind the meeting that the Lord Jesus
Christ, who never made mistakes, said Himself, "As Jonah was three days
and three nights in the interior of the sea monster." Please note that
in the Greek the word was not "whale," but "sea monster." And then, let
us remember, that we were told that the Lord God had prepared the great
fish in order that it should swallow Jonah. She did suggest that if mere
man nowadays could construct a submarine, which went down to the depths
of the ocean and came up again when he pleased, it did not require very
much faith to believe that Almighty God could specially prepare a great
fish which should rescue His servant, to whom He meant to give another
chance, from the depths of the sea, and land him in due course upon the
shore. (Applause).' These crude views, which ignored the symbolism of
Nineveh as a fish, now universally accepted by educated people, were
not, however, endorsed by Dr. Beeching, the learned Dean of Norwich, who
in the same gathering expressed the point of view of more scholarly
Christians:&mdash;'He would not distinguish inspired writing from fiction. He
would say there could be inspired fiction just as well as inspired
facts, and he would point to the story of the prodigal son as a
wonderful example from the Bible of inspired fiction. There were a good
many other examples in the Old Testament, and he had not the faintest
doubt that the story of Jonah was one. It was on the same level as the
prodigal son. It was a story told to teach the people a distinct
truth.'</p></div>

Summers, the courteous Secretary of the Madrid Branch of the British and
Foreign Bible Society in the Flor Alta. Mr. Summers informs me that the

in Spain for the past three years are as follows:</p>

<h3>BORROW'S SPANISH CIRCLE</h3>


<p>There are many interesting personalities that pass before us in Borrow's
three separate narratives,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> as they may be considered, of his
Spanish experiences. We would fain know more concerning the two
excellent secretaries of the Bible Society&mdash;Samuel Brandram and Joseph
Jowett. We merely know that the former was rector of Beckenham and was
one of the Society's secretaries until his death in 1850;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that the
latter was rector of Silk Willoughby in Lincolnshire, and belonged to
the same family as Jowett of Balliol. But there are many quaint
characters in Borrow's own narrative to whom we are introduced. There is
Maria Diaz, for example, his landlady in the house in the Calle de
Santiago in Madrid, and her husband, Juan Lopez, also assisted Borrow in
his Bible distribution. Very eloquent are Borrow's tributes to the pair
in the pages of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. 'Honour to Maria Diaz, the quiet,
dauntless, clever, Castilian female! I were an ungrate not to speak well
of her,' We get a glimpse of Maria and her husband long years afterwards
when a pensioner in a Spanish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> almshouse revealed himself as the son of
Borrow's friends. Eduardo Lopez was only eight years of age when Borrow
was in Madrid, and he really adds nothing to our knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Then
there were those two incorrigible vagabonds&mdash;Antonio Buchini, his Greek
servant with an Italian name, and Benedict Mol, the Swiss of Lucerne,
who turns up in all sorts of improbable circumstances as the seeker of
treasure in the Church of St. James of Compostella&mdash;only a masterly
imagination could have made him so interesting. Concerning these there
is nothing to supplement Borrow's own story. But we have attractive
glimpses of Borrow in the frequently quoted narrative of Colonel
Napier,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and this is so illuminating that I venture to reproduce it
at greater length than previous biographers have done. Edward Elers
Napier, who was born in 1808, was the son of one Edward Elers of the
Royal Navy. His widow married the famous Admiral Sir Charles Napier, who
adopted her four children by her first husband. Edward Elers, the
younger, or Edward Napier, as he came to be called, was educated at
Sandhurst and entered the army, serving for some years in India. Later
his regiment was ordered to Gibraltar, and it was thence that he made
several sporting excursions into Spain and Morocco. Later he served in
Egypt, and when, through ill-health, he retired in 1843 on half-pay, he
lived for some years in Portugal. In 1854 he returned to the army and
did good work in the Crimea, becoming a lieutenant-general in 1864. He
died in 1870. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> wrote, in addition to these <i>Excursions</i>, several
other books, including <i>Scenes and Sports in Foreign Lands</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> It was
during his military career at Gibraltar that he met George Borrow at
Seville, as the following extracts from his book testify. Borrow's
pretension to have visited the East is characteristic&mdash;and amusing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1839. <i>Saturday 4th</i>.&mdash;Out early, sketching at the Alcazar.
After breakfast it set in a day of rain, and I was reduced to
wander about the galleries overlooking the 'patio.' Nothing so
dreary and out of character as a rainy day in Spain. Whilst
occupied in moralising over the dripping water-spouts, I
observed a tall, gentlemanly-looking man, dressed in a
zamarra,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> leaning over the balustrades, and apparently
engaged in a similar manner with myself. Community of thoughts
and occupation generally tends to bring people together. From
the stranger's complexion, which was fair, but with brilliant
black eyes, I concluded he was not a Spaniard; in short, there
was something so remarkable in his appearance that it was
difficult to say to what nation he might belong. He was tall,
with a commanding appearance; yet, though apparently in the
flower of manhood, his hair was so deeply tinged with the
winter of either age or sorrow as to be nearly snow-white.
Under these circumstances, I was rather puzzled as to what
language I should address him in. At last, putting a bold face
on the matter, I approached him with a 'Bonjour, monsieur, quel
triste temps!'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' replied he in the purest Parisian accent; 'and it
is very unusual weather here at this time of the year.'</p>

<p>'Does "monsieur" intend to be any time at Seville?' asked I. He
replied in the affirmative. We were soon on a friendly footing,
and from his varied information I was both amused and
instructed. Still I became more than ever in the dark as to his
nationality; I found he could speak English as fluently as
French. I tried him on the Italian track; again he was
perfectly at home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a Greek servant, to whom his gave his orders in Roma&iuml;c.
He conversed in good Castilian with 'mine host'; exchanged a
German salutation with an Austrian Baron, at the time an inmate
of the fonda; and on mentioning to him my morning visit to
Triano, which led to some remarks on the gypsies, and the
probable place from whence they derived their origin, he
expressed his belief that it was from Moultan, and said that,
even to this day, they retained many Moultanee and Hindoostanee
expressions, such as 'p&aacute;nee' (water), 'buree p&aacute;nee'<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> (the
sea), etc. He was rather startled when I replied 'in Hindee,'
but was delighted on finding I was an Indian, and entered
freely, and with depth and acuteness, on the affairs of the
East, most of which part of the world he had visited.</p>

<p>In such varied discourse did the hours pass so swiftly away
that we were not a little surprised when P&eacute;p&eacute;, the 'mozo' (and
I verily believe all Spanish waiters are called P&eacute;p&eacute;),
announced the hour of dinner; after which we took a long walk
together on the banks of the river. But, on our return, I was
as much as ever in ignorance as to who might be my new and
pleasant acquaintance.</p>

<p>I took the first opportunity of questioning Antonio Baillie
(Buchini) on the subject, and his answer only tended to
increase my curiosity. He said that nobody knew what nation the
mysterious 'Unknown' belonged to, nor what were his motives for
travelling. In his passport he went by the name of &mdash;&mdash;, and as
a British subject, but in consequence of a suspicion being
entertained that he was a Russian spy, the police kept a sharp
look-out over him. Spy or no spy, I found him a very agreeable
companion; and it was agreed that on the following day we
should visit together the ruins of Italica.</p>

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;After breakfast, the 'Unknown' and myself, mounting
our horses, proceeded on our expedition to the ruins of
Italica. Crossing the river, and proceeding through the
populous suburb of Triano, already mentioned, we went over the
same extensive plain that I had traversed in going to San
Lucar, but keeping a little more to the right a short ride
brought us in sight of the Convent of San Isidrio, surrounded
by tall cypress and waving date-trees. This once richly-endowed
religious establishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> is, together with the small
neighbouring village of Santi Ponci, I believe, the property of
the Duke of Medina Coeli, at whose expense the excavations are
now carried on at the latter place, which is the ancient site
of the Roman Italica.</p>

<p>We sat down on a fragment of the walls, and sadly recalling the
splendour of those times of yore, contrasted with the
desolation around us, the 'Unknown' began to feel the vein of
poetry creeping through his inward soul, and gave vent to it by
reciting, with great emphasis and effect, and to the
astonishment of the wondering peasant, who must have thought
him 'loco,' the following well-known and beautiful  lines:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower, grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Matted and massed together, hillocks heap'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what were chambers, arch crush'd, column strown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In fragments, choked up vaults, and frescoes steep'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In subterranean damps, where the owl peep'd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pronounce who can: for all that Learning reap'd<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From her research hath been, that these are walls.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I had been too much taken up with the scene, the verses, and
the strange being who was repeating them with so much feeling,
to notice the approach of one who now formed the fourth person
of our party. This was a slight female figure, beautiful in the
extreme, but whom tattered garments, raven hair (which fell in
matted elf-locks over her naked shoulders), swarthy complexion,
and flashing eyes, proclaimed to be of the wandering tribe of
'git&aacute;nos.' From an intuitive sense of natural politeness she
stood with crossed arms, and a slight smile on her dark and
handsome countenance, until my companion had ceased, and then
addressed us in the usual whining tone of supplication, with
'Caballeritos, una limosita! Dios se lo pagara a ustedes!'
('Gentlemen, a little charity! God will repay it to you!') The
gypsy girl was so pretty, and her voice so sweet, that I
involuntarily put my hand in my pocket.</p>

<p>'Stop!' said the 'Unknown.' 'Do you remember what I told you
about the Eastern origin of these people? You shall see I am
correct. Come here, my pretty child,' said he in Moultanee,
'and tell me where are the rest of your tribe?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl looked astounded, replied in the same tongue, but in
broken language; when, taking him by the arm, she said, in
Spanish: 'Come, caballero; come to one who will be able to
answer you;' and she led the way down amongst the ruins towards
one of the dens formerly occupied by the wild beasts, and
disclosed to us a set of beings scarcely less savage. The
sombre walls of this gloomy abode were illumined by a fire, the
smoke from which escaped through a deep fissure in the massy
roof; whilst the flickering flames threw a blood-red glare on
the bronzed features of a group of children, of two men, and a
decrepit old hag, who appeared busily engaged in some culinary
preparations.</p>

<p>On our entrance, the scowling glance of the males of the party,
and a quick motion of the hand towards the folds of the
'faja,'<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> caused in <i>me</i>, at least, anything but a
comfortable sensation; but their hostile intentions, if ever
entertained, were immediately removed by a wave of the hand
from our conductress, who, leading my companion towards the
sibyl, whispered something in her ear. The old crone appeared
incredulous. The 'Unknown' uttered one word; but that word had
the effect of magic; she prostrated herself at his feet, and in
an instant, from an object of suspicion he became one of
worship to the whole family, to whom, on taking leave, he made
a handsome present, and departed with their united blessings,
to the astonishment of myself, and what looked very like terror
in our Spanish guide.</p>

<p>I was, as the phrase goes, dying with curiosity, and, as soon
as we mounted our horses, exclaimed, 'Where, in the name of
goodness, did you pick up your acquaintance and the language of
these extraordinary people?' 'Some years ago, in Moultan,' he
replied. 'And by what means do you possess such apparent
influence over them?' But the 'Unknown' had already said more
than he perhaps wished on the subject. He drily replied that he
had more than once owed his life to gipsies, and had reason to
know them well; but this was said in a tone which precluded all
further queries on my part. The subject was never again
broached, and we returned in silence to the fonda....</p>

<p><i>May 7th.</i>&mdash;Pouring with rain all day, during which I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
mostly in the society of the 'Unknown.' This is a most
extraordinary character, and the more I see of him the more I
am puzzled. He appears acquainted with everybody and
everything, but apparently unknown to every one himself. Though
his figure bespeaks youth&mdash;and by his own account his age does
not exceed thirty&mdash;yet the snows of eighty winters could not
have whitened his locks more completely than they are. But in
his dark and searching eye there is an almost supernatural
penetration and lustre, which, were I inclined to superstition,
might induce me to set down its possessor as a second Melmoth;
and in that character he often appears to me during the
troubled rest I sometimes obtain through the medium of the
great soother, 'laudanum.'</p></div>

<p>The next most interesting figure in the Borrow gallery of this period is
Don Luis de Us&oacute;z y Rio, who was a good friend to Borrow during the whole
of his sojourn in Spain. It was he who translated Borrow's appeal to the
Spanish Prime Minister to be permitted to distribute Scio's New
Testament. He watched over Borrow with brotherly solicitude, and wrote
him more than one excellent letter, of which the two following from my
Borrow Papers, the last written at the close of the Spanish period, are
the most interesting:</p>


<h3>To Mr. George Borrow</h3>

<p>(<i>Translated from the Spanish</i>)</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Piazza di Spagna 17, Rome</span>, <i>7 April 1838.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I received your letter, and thank you for the
same. I know the works under the name of 'Boz,' about which you
write, and also the <i>Memoirs of the Pickwick Club</i>, and
although they seemed to me good, I have failed to appreciate
properly their qualities, because much of the dramatic style
and dialogue in the same are very difficult for those who know
English merely from books. I made here a better acquaintance
than that of Mezzofanti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> (who knows nothing), namely, that of
Prof. Michel-Angelo Lanci, already well-known on account of his
work, <i>La sacra scrittura illustrata con monumenti
fenico-assiri ed egiziani</i>, etc., etc. (The Scriptures,
illustrated with Ph&#339;nician-Assyrian and Egyptian monuments),
which I am reading at present, and find very profound and
interesting, and more particularly very original. He has
written and presented me a book, <i>Esposizione dei versetti del
Giobbe intorno al cavallo</i> (Explanation of verses of Job about
a horse), and in these and other works he proves himself to be
a great philologist and Oriental scholar. I meet him almost
daily, and I assure you that he seems to me to know everything
he treats thoroughly, and not like Gayangos or Calderon, etc.,
etc. His philosophic works have created a great stir here, and
they do not please much the friars here; but as here they are
not like the police barbarians there, they do not forbid it, as
they cannot. Lanci is well known in Russia and in Germany, and
when I bring his works there, and you are there and have not
read them, you will read them and judge for yourself.</p>

<p>Wishing you well, and always at your service, I remain, always
yours,</p></div>

<h3>To Mr. George Borrow</h3>

<p>(<i>Translated from the Spanish</i>)</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Naples</span>, <i>28 August 1839.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I received your letter of the 28 July written
from Sevilla, and I am waiting for that which you promise me
from Tangier.</p>

<p>I am glad that you liked Sevilla, and I am still more glad of
the successful shipment of the beloved book. In distributing
it, you are rendering the greatest service that generous
foreigners (I mean Englishmen) can render to the real freedom
and enlightenment in Spain, and any Spaniard who is at heart a
gentleman must be grateful for this service to the Society and
to its agent. In my opinion, if Spain had maintained the
customs, character, and opinions that it had three centuries
ago, it ought to have maintained also unity in religious
opinions: but that at present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> the circumstances have changed,
and the moral character and the advancement of my unfortunate
country would not lose anything in its purification and
progress by (the grant of) religious liberty.</p>

<p>You are saying that I acted very light-mindedly in judging
Mezzofanti without speaking to him. You know that the other
time when I was in Italy I had dealings and spoke with him, and
that I said to you that he had a great facility for speaking
languages, but that otherwise he was no good. Because I have
seen him several times in the Papal chapels with a certain air
of an ass and certain grimaces of a blockhead that cannot
happen to a man of talent. I am told, moreover, that he is a
spy, and that for that reason he was given the hat. I know,
moreover, that he has not written anything at all. For that
reason I do not wish to take the trouble of seeing him.</p>

<p>As regards Lanci, I am not saying anything except that I am
waiting until you have read his work without passion, and that
if my books have arrived at Madrid, you can ask my brother in
Santiago.</p>

<p>You are judging of him and of Pahlin in the way you reproach me
with judging Mezzofanti; I thank you, and I wish for the
dedication Gabricote; and I also wish for your return to
Madrid, so that in going to Toledo you would get a copy of
Aristophanes with the order that will be given to you by my
brother, who has got it.</p>

<p>If for the Gabricote or other work you require my clumsy pen,
write to Florence and send me a rough copy of what is to be
done, in English or in Spanish, and I will supply the finished
work. From Florence I intend to go to London, and I should be
obliged if you would give me letters and instructions that
would be of use to me in literary matters, but you must know
that my want of knowledge of <i>speaking</i> English makes it
necessary that the Englishmen who speak to me should know
Spanish, French, or Italian.</p>

<p>As regards robberies, of which you accuse Southern people, from
the literatures of the North, do you think that the robberies
committed by the Northerners from the Southern literature would
be left behind? Erunt vitia donec homines.&mdash;Always yours,</p></div>

<p>Yet another acquaintance of these Spanish days was Baron Taylor&mdash;Isidore
Justin S&eacute;verin Taylor, to give him his full name&mdash;who had a career of
wandering achievement, with Government pay, that must have appealed to
Borrow. Although his father was an Englishman he became a naturalised
Frenchman, and he was for a time in the service of the French Government
as Director of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, when he had no little share in the
production of the dramas of Victor Hugo and Dumas. Later he was
instrumental in bringing the Luxor obelisk from Egypt to Paris. He wrote
books upon his travels in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> He wandered
all over Europe in search of art treasures for the French Government,
and may very well have met Borrow again and again. Borrow tells us that
he had met Taylor in France, in Russia, and in Ireland, before he met
him in Andalusia, collecting pictures for the French Government.
Borrow's description of their meetings is inimitable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whenever he descries me, whether in the street or the desert,
the brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin <i>haimas</i>, at Novogorod or
Stambul, he flings up his arms and exclaims, "<i>O ciel</i>! I have
again the felicity of seeing my cherished and most respectable

CLARENDON, BRITISH MINISTER TO SPAIN, TO GEORGE BORROW" title="" />
<span class="caption">A LETTER FROM SIR GEORGE VILLIERS, AFTERWARDS EARL OF
CLARENDON, BRITISH MINISTER TO SPAIN, TO GEORGE BORROW</span>
</div>

<p>The last and most distinguished of Borrow's colleagues while in Spain
was George Villiers, fourth Earl of Clarendon, whom we judge to have
been in private life one of the most lovable men of his epoch. George
Villiers was born in London in 1800, and was the grandson of the first
Earl, Thomas Villiers, who received his title when holding office in
Lord North's administration, but is best known from his association in
diplomacy with Frederick the Great. His grandson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> was born, as it were,
into diplomacy, and at twenty years of age was an <i>attach&eacute;</i> to the
British Embassy in St. Petersburg. Later he was associated with Sir John
Bowring in negotiating a commercial treaty with France. In August 1833
he was sent as British Minister&mdash;'envoy extraordinary' he was called&mdash;to
Madrid, and he had been two years in that seething-pot of Spanish
affairs, with Christinos and Carlists at one another's throats, when
Borrow arrived in the Peninsula. His influence was the greater with a
succession of Spanish Prime Ministers in that in 1838 he had been
largely instrumental in negotiating the quadruple alliance between
England, France, Spain, and Portugal. In March 1839&mdash;exactly a year
before Borrow took his departure&mdash;he resigned his position at Madrid,
having then for some months exchanged the title of Sir George Villiers
for that of Earl of Clarendon through the death of his uncle;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Borrow thereafter having to launch his various complaints and grievances
at his successor, Mr.&mdash;afterwards Sir George&mdash;Jerningham, who, it has
been noted, had his home in Norfolk, at Costessey, four miles from
Norwich. Villiers returned to England with a great reputation, although
his Spanish policy was attacked in the House of Lords. In that same
year, 1839, he joined Lord Melbourne's administration as Lord Privy
Seal, O'Connell at the time declaring that he ought to be made
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, so sympathetic was he towards concession and
conciliation in that then feverishly excited country. This office
actually came to him in 1847, and he was Lord-Lieutenant through that
dark period of Ireland's history, including the Famine, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> Young
Ireland rebellion, and the Smith O'Brien rising. He pleased no one in
Ireland. No English statesman could ever have done so under such ideals
of government as England would have tolerated then, and for long years
afterwards. The Whigs defended him, the Tories abused him, in their
respective organs. He left Ireland in 1852 and was more than once
mentioned as possible Prime Minister in the ensuing years. He was
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Lord Aberdeen's Administration
during the Crimean War, and he held the same office under Lord
Palmerston, again under Earl Russell in 1865, and under Mr. Gladstone in
1868. He might easily have become Prime Minister. Greville in his
<i>Diary</i> writes of Prince Albert's desire that he should succeed Lord
John Russell, but Clarendon said that no power on earth would make him
take that position. He said he could not speak, and had not had
parliamentary experience enough. He died in 1870, leaving a reputation
as a skilful diplomatist and a disinterested politician, if not that of
a great statesman. He had twice refused the Governor-Generalship of
India, and three times a marquisate.</p>

<p>Sir George Villiers seems to have been very courteous to Borrow during
the whole of the time they were together in Spain. It would have been
easy for him to have been quite otherwise. Borrow's Bible mission
synchronised with a very delicate diplomatic mission of his own, and in
a measure clashed with it. The government of Spain was at the time
fighting the ultra-clericals. Physical and moral strife were rife in the
land. Neither Royalists nor Carlists could be expected to sympathise
with Borrow's schemes, which were fundamentally to attack their church.
But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> Villiers was at all times friendly, and, as far as he could be,
helpful. Borrow seems to have had ready access to him, and he answered
his many letters. He gave Borrow an opportunity of an interview with the
formidable Prime Minister Mendiz&aacute;bal, and he interviewed another
minister and persuaded him to permit Borrow to print and circulate his
Bibles. He intervened successfully to release Borrow from his Madrid
prison. But Villiers could not have had any sympathy with Borrow other
than as a British subject to be protected on the Roman citizen
principle. We do not suppose that when <i>The Bible in Spain</i> appeared he
was one of those who were captivated by its extraordinary qualities.
When Borrow crossed his path in later life he received no special
consideration, such as would be given very promptly in our day by a
Cabinet minister to a man of letters of like distinction. We find him on
one occasion writing to the ex-minister, now Lord Clarendon, asking his
help for a consulship. Clarendon replied kindly enough, but sheltered
himself behind the statement that the Prime Minister was overwhelmed
with applications for patronage. Yet Clarendon, who held many high
offices in the following years, might have helped if he had cared to do
so. Some years later&mdash;in 1847&mdash;there was further correspondence when
Borrow desired to become a Magistrate of Suffolk. Here again Clarendon
wrote three courteous letters, and appears to have done his best in an
unenthusiastic way. But nothing came of it all.</p>

<h3>MARY BORROW</h3>


<p>Among the many Borrow manuscripts in my possession I find a page of
unusual pathos. It is the inscription that Borrow wrote for his wife's
tomb, and it is in the tremulous handwriting of a man weighed down by
the one incomparable tragedy of life's pilgrimage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sacred to the Memory of Mary Borrow,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>the Beloved and Affectionate Wife of</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>George Borrow, Esquire, who departed</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>this Life on the 30th Jan. 1869.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The death of his wife saddened Borrow, and assisted to transform him
into the unamiable creature of Norfolk tradition. But it is well to bear
in mind, when we are considering Borrow on his domestic and personal
side, that he was unquestionably a good and devoted husband throughout
his married life of twenty-nine years. It was in the year 1832 that
Borrow and his wife first met. He was twenty-nine; she was a widow of
thirty-six. She was undeniably very intelligent, and was keenly
sympathetic to the young vagabond of wonderful adventures on the
highways of England, now so ambitious for future adventure in distant
lands. Her maiden name was Mary Skepper. She was one of the two children
of Edmund Skepper and his wife Anne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> who lived at Oulton Hall in
Suffolk, whither they had removed from Beceles in 1805. Mary's brother
inherited the Oulton Hall estate of three hundred acres, and she had a
mortgage the interest of which yielded &pound;450 per annum. In July 1817 Mary
married, at Oulton Church, Henry Clarke,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> a lieutenant in the Navy,
who died eight months later of consumption. Two months after his death
their child Henrietta Mary, the 'Hen' who was Borrow's life companion,
was born. There is a letter among my Borrow Papers addressed to the
widow by her husband's father at this time. It is dated 17th June 1818,
and runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I read your very kind, affectionate, and respectful Letter of
the 15th Inst. with Feelings of Satisfaction and
thankfulness&mdash;thankful that God has mercifully given you so
pleasing a Pledge of the Love of my late dear, but lamented
son, and I most sincerely hope and trust that dear little
Henrietta will live to be the Joy and Consolation of your Life:
and satisfyed I am that you are what I always esteemed you to
be, <i>one</i> of the best of Women; God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> grant! that you may be, as
I am sure you deserve to be <i>one</i> of the happiest&mdash;His Ways of
Providence are past finding out; to you&mdash;they seem indeed to
have been truly afflictive: but we cannot possibly say that
they are really so; we cannot doubt His Wisdom nor ought we to
distrust His Goodness, let us avow, then, where we have not the
Power of fathoming&mdash;viz. the dispensations of God; in His good
time He will show us, perhaps, that every painful Event which
has happened was abundantly for the best&mdash;I am truly glad to
hear that you and the sweet Babe, my little grand Daughter, are
doing so well, and I hope I shall have the pleasure shortly of
seeing you either at Oulton or Sisland. I am sorry to add that
neither Poor L. nor myself are well.&mdash;Louisa and my Family join
me in kind love to you, and in best regards to your worthy
Father, Mother, and Brother.</p></div>

<p>Mary Skepper was certainly a bright, intelligent girl, as I gather from
a manuscript poem before me written to a friend on the eve of leaving
school. As a widow, living at first with her parents at Oulton Hall, and
later with her little daughter in the neighbouring cottage, she would
seem to have busied herself with all kinds of philanthropies, and she
was clearly in sympathy with the religious enthusiasms of certain
neighbouring families of Evangelical persuasion, particularly the
Gurneys and the Cunninghams. The Rev. Francis Cunningham was Rector of
Pakefield, near Lowestoft, from 1814 to 1830. He married Richenda, a
sister of the distinguished Joseph John Gurney and of Elizabeth Fry, in
1816. In 1830 he became Vicar of St. Margaret's, Lowestoft. His brother,
John William Cunningham, was Vicar of Harrow, and married a Verney of
the famous Buckinghamshire family. This John William Cunningham was a
great light of the Evangelical Churches of his time, and was for many
years editor of <i>The Christian Observer</i>. His daughter Mary Richenda
married Sir James Fitzjames Stephen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> the well-known judge, and the
brother of Sir Leslie Stephen. But to return to Francis Cunningham,
whose acquaintance with Borrow was brought about through Mrs. Clarke.
Cunningham was a great supporter of the British and Foreign Bible
Society, and was the founder of the Paris branch. It was speedily
revealed to him that Borrow's linguistic abilities could be utilised by
the Society, and he secured the co-operation of his brother-in-law,
Joseph John Gurney, in an effort to find Borrow work in connection with
the Society. There is a letter of Borrow's to Mrs. Clarke of this period
in my Borrow Papers which my readers will already have read.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>We do not meet Mary Clarke again until 1834, when we find a letter from
her to Borrow addressed to St. Petersburg, in which she notifies to him
that he has been 'mentioned at many of the Bible Meetings this year,'
adding that 'dear Mr. Cunningham' had spoken so nicely of him at an
Oulton gathering. 'As I am not afraid of making you proud,' she
continues, 'I will tell you one of his remarks. He mentioned you as one
of the most extraordinary and interesting individuals of the present
day.' Henceforth clearly Mary Clarke corresponded regularly with Borrow,
and one or two extracts from her letters are given by Dr. Knapp. Joseph
Jowett of the Bible Society forwarded Borrow's letters from Russia to
Cunningham, who handed them to Mrs. Clarke and her parents. Borrow had
proposed to continue his mission by leaving Russia for China, but this
Mary Clarke opposed:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>I must tell you that your letter chilled me when I read your
intention of going as a Missionary or Agent, with the Manchu
Scriptures in your hand, to the Tartars, that land of
incalculable dangers.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p></div>

<p>In 1835 Borrow was back in England at Norwich with his mother, and on a
visit to Mary Clarke and the Skeppers at Oulton. Mrs. Skepper died just
before his arrival in England&mdash;that is, in September 1835&mdash;while her
husband died in February 1836. Mary Clarke's only brother died in the
following year.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see Mary Clarke, aged about forty, left to fight the world with
her daughter, aged twenty-three, and not only to fight the world but her
own family, particularly her brother's widow, owing to certain
ambiguities in her father's will which are given forth in dreary detail
in Dr. Knapp's <i>Life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> It was these legal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> quarrels that led Mary
Clarke and her daughter to set sail for Spain, where Mary had had the
indefatigable and sympathetic correspondent during the previous year of
trouble. Borrow and Mary Clarke met, as we have seen, at Seville and
there, at a later period, they became 'engaged.' Mrs. Clarke and her
daughter Henrietta sailed for Spain in the <i>Royal Tar</i>, leaving London
for Cadiz in June 1839. Much keen correspondence between Borrow and Mrs.
Clarke had passed before the final decision to visit Spain. His mother
was one of the few people who knew of Mrs. Clarke's journey to Seville,
and must have understood, as mothers do, what was pending, although her
son did not. When the engagement is announced to her&mdash;in November
1839&mdash;she writes to Mary Clarke a kindly, affectionate letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I shall now resign him to your care, and may you love and
cherish him as much as I have done. I hope and trust that each
will try to make the other happy.</p></div>

<p>There is no reason whatever to accept Dr. Knapp's suggestion,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
strange as coming from so pronounced a hero-worshipper, that Borrow
married for money. And this because he had said in one of his letters,
'It is better to suffer the halter than the yoke,' the kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> thing
that a man might easily say on the eve of making a proposal which he was
not sure would be accepted. Nor can Dr. Knapp's further discovery of a
casual remark of Borrow's&mdash;'marriage is by far the best way of getting
possession of an estate'&mdash;be counted as conclusive. That Borrow was all
his life devoted to his wife I think is proved by his many letters to
her that are given in this volume, letters, however, which Dr. Knapp had
not seen. Borrow's further tribute to his wife and stepdaughter in <i>Wild
Wales</i> is well known:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of my wife I will merely say that she is a perfect paragon of
wives, can make puddings and sweets and treacle posset, and is
the best woman of business in Eastern Anglia. Of my
stepdaughter&mdash;for such she is, though I generally call her
daughter, and with good reason, seeing that she has always
shown herself a daughter to me&mdash;that she has all kinds of good
qualities, and several accomplishments, knowing something of
conchology, more of botany, drawing capitally in the Dutch
style, and playing remarkably well on the guitar&mdash;not the
trumpery German thing so called, but the real Spanish guitar.</p></div>

<p>Borrow belonged to the type of men who would never marry did not some
woman mercifully take them in hand. Mrs. Clarke, when she set out for
Spain, had doubtless determined to marry Borrow. It is clear that he had
no idea of marrying her. Yet he was certainly 'engaged,' as we learn
from a letter to Mr. Brackenbury, to be given hereafter, when he wrote a
letter from Seville to Mr. Brandram, dated March 18, in which he said:
'I wish very much to spend the remaining years of my life in the
northern parts of China, as I think I have a call to those regions.... I
hope yet to die in the cause of my Redeemer.' Surely never did man take
so curious a view of the responsibilities of marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> He must have
known that his proposal would be declined&mdash;as it was.</p>

<p>Very soon after the engagement Borrow experienced his third term of
imprisonment in Spain, this time, however, only for thirty hours, and
all because he had asked the Alcalde, or mayor of the district in which
he lived, for his passport, and had quarrelled with his worship over the
matter. Borrow gave up the months of this winter of 1839 rather to
writing his first important book, <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>, than to the
concerns of the Bible Society. Finally Borrow, with Mrs. Clarke and her
daughter, sailed from Cadiz on the 3rd April 1840, as we have already
related. He had with him his Jewish servant, Hayim Ben Attar, and his
Arabian horse, Sidi Habismilk, both of which were to astonish the
natives of the Suffolk broads. The party reached London on 16th April
and stayed at the Spread Eagle Inn, Gracechurch Street. The marriage
took place at St. Peter's Church, Cornhill, on 23rd April 1840.</p>

</div>

<p>There are only two letters from Mrs. Borrow to her husband extant. Dr.
Knapp apparently discovered none in the Borrow Papers in his possession.
The two before me were written in the Hereford Square days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> between the
years 1860 and 1869&mdash;the last year of Mrs. Borrow's life. The pair had
been married some twenty-five years at least, and it is made clear by
these letters alone that at the end of this period they were still a
most happily assorted couple. Mrs. Borrow must have gone to Brighton for
her health on two separate occasions, each time accompanied by her
daughter. Borrow, who had enjoyed many a pleasant ramble on his own
account, as we shall see&mdash;rambles which extended as far away as
Constantinople&mdash;is 'keeping house' in Hereford Square, Brompton, the
while. It will be noted that Mrs. Borrow signed herself 'Carreta,' the
pet name that her husband always gave her. Dr. Knapp points out that
'carreta' means a Spanish dray-cart, and that 'carita,' 'my dear,' was
probably meant. But, careless as was the famous word-master over the
spelling of words in the tongues that he never really mastered
scientifically, he could scarcely have made so obvious a blunder as
this, and there must have been some particular experience in the lives
of husband and wife that led to the playful designation.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Here are
the two letters:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Grenville Place, Brighton, Sussex.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My darling Husband</span>,&mdash;I am thankful to say that I arrived here
quite safe on Saturday, and on Wednesday I hope to see you at
home. We may not be home before the evening about six o'clock,
sooner or later, so do not be anxious, as we shall be careful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
We took tea with the Edwards at six o'clock the day I came;
they are a very kind, nice family. You must take a walk when we
come home, but remember now we have a young servant, and do not
leave the house for very long together. The air here is very
fresh, and much cooler than in London, and I hope after the
five days' change I shall be benefited, but I wish to come home
on Wednesday. See to all the doors and windows of a night, and
let Jane keep up the chain, and lock the back door by the hop
plant before it gets dark. Our love to Lady Soame.&mdash;And with
our best love to you, believe me, your own</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Carreta.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Sunday morning, 10 o'clock.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If I do not hear from you I shall conclude all is well, and you
may do the same with regard to us. Have the tea ready a little
before six on Wednesday. Henrietta is wonderfully improved by
the change, and sends dear and best love to you.</p></div>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">33 <span class="smcap">Grenville Place, Brighton, Sussex</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Thursday morning</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Husband</span>,&mdash;As it is raining again this morning I write a
few lines to you. I cannot think that we have quite so much
rain as you have at Brompton, for I was out <i>twice</i> yesterday,
an hour in the morning in a Bath chair, and a little walk in
the evening on the Marine Parade, and I have been out little or
much every day, and hope I feel a little better. Our dear
Henrietta likewise says that she feels the better for the air
and change. As we are here I think we had better remain till
Tuesday next, when the fortnight will be up, but I fear you
feel very lonely. I hope you get out when you can, and that you
take care of your health. I hope Ellen continues to attend to
yr. comfort, and that when she gives orders to Mrs. Harvey or
the Butcher that she shews<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> you what they send. I shall want
the stair carpets down, and the drawing-room <i>nice</i>&mdash;blinds and
shutters closed to prevent the sun, also bed-rooms prepared,
with well <i>aired sheets</i> and counterpane <i>by next Tuesday</i>. I
suppose we shall get to Hereford Square perhaps about five
o'clock, but I shall write again. You had better dine at yr.
usual time, and as we shall get a dinner here we shall want
only tea.</p>

<p>Henrietta's kindest dear love and mine, remaining yr. true and
affectionate wife.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Carreta.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>There is one letter from Borrow to his wife, written from London in
1843, in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have not been particularly well since I wrote last; indeed,
the weather has been so horrible that it is enough to depress
anybody's spirits, and, of course, mine. I did very wrong not
to bring you when I came, for without you I cannot get on at
all. Left to myself a gloom comes upon me which I cannot
describe.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></div>

<p>Assuredly no reader can peruse the following pages without recognising
the true affection for his wife that is transparent in his letters to
her. Arthur Dalrymple's remark that he had frequently seen Borrow and
his wife travelling:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He stalking along with a huge cloak wrapped round him in all
weathers, and she trudging behind him like an Indian squaw,
with a carpet bag, or bundle, or small portmanteau in her arms,
and endeavouring under difficulty to keep up with his enormous
strides,</p></div>

<p>is clearly a travesty. 'Mrs. Borrow was devoted to her husband, and
looked after business matters; and he always treated her with exceeding
kindness,' is the verdict of Miss Elizabeth Jay, who was frequently
privileged to visit the husband and wife at Oulton.</p>

of her to "Hen." Borrow always called her "Mamma." Mrs. MacOubrey took a

character, not in person.'</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>'THE CHILDREN OF THE OPEN AIR'</h3>


<p>Behold George Borrow, then, in a comfortable home on the banks of Oulton
Broad&mdash;a family man. His mother&mdash;sensible woman&mdash;declines her son's
invitation to live with the newly-married pair. She remains in the
cottage at Norwich where her husband died. The Borrows were married in
April 1840, by May they had settled at Oulton. It was a pleasantly
secluded estate, and Borrow's wife had &pound;450 a year. He had, a month
before his marriage, written to Mr. Brandram to say that he had a work
nearly ready for publication, and 'two others in a state of
forwardness.' The title of the first of these books he enclosed in his
letter. It was <i>The Zincali: Or an Account of the Gypsies of Spain</i>. Mr.
Samuel Smiles, in his history of the House of Murray&mdash;<i>A Publisher and
his Friends</i>&mdash;thus relates the circumstances of its publication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In November 1840 a tall, athletic gentleman in black called
upon Mr. Murray offering a MS. for perusal and publication....
Mr. Murray could not fail to be taken at first sight with this
extraordinary man. He had a splendid physique, standing six
feet two in his stockings, and he had brains as well as
muscles, as his works sufficiently show. The book now submitted
was of a very uncommon character, and neither the author nor
the publisher were very sanguine about its success. Mr. Murray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
agreed, after perusal, to print and publish 750 copies of <i>The
Gypsies of Spain</i>, and divide the profits with the author.</p></div>

<p>It was at the suggestion of Richard Ford, then the greatest living
English authority on Spain, that Mr. Murray published the book. It did
not really commence to sell until <i>The Bible in Spain</i> came a year or so
later to bring the author reputation.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> From November 1840 to June
1841 only three hundred copies had been sold in spite of friendly
reviews in some half dozen journals, including <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> and <i>The
Literary Gazette</i>. The first edition, it may be mentioned, contained on
its title-page a description of the author as 'late agent of the British
and Foreign Bible Society in Spain.'<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> There is very marked
compression in the edition now in circulation, and a perusal of the
first edition reveals many interesting features that deserve to be
restored for the benefit of the curious. But nothing can make <i>The
Zincali</i> a great piece of literature. It was summarised by the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> at the time as 'a hotch-potch of the jockey, tramper,
philologist, and missionary.' That description, which was not intended
to be as flattering as it sounds to-day, appears more to apply to <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>. But <i>The Zincali</i> is too confused, too ill-arranged a
book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> to rank with Borrow's four great works. There are passages in it,
indeed, so eloquent, so romantic, that no lover of Borrow's writings can
afford to neglect them. But this was not the book that gypsy-loving
Borrow, with the temperament of a Romany, should have written, or could
have written had he not been obsessed by the 'science' of his subject.
His real work in gypsydom was to appear later in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The
Romany Rye</i>. For Borrow was not a man of science&mdash;a philologist, a
folk-lorist of the first order.</p>

<p>No one, indeed, who had read only <i>The Zincali</i> among Borrow's works
could see in it any suspicion of the writer who was for all time to
throw a glamour over the gypsy, to make the 'children of the open air' a
veritable cult, to earn for him the title of 'the walking lord of gypsy
lore,' and to lay the foundations of an admirable succession of books
both in fact and fiction&mdash;but not one as great as his own. The city of
Seville, it is clear, with sarcastic letters from Bible Society
secretaries on one side, and some manner of love romance on the other,
was not so good a place for an author to produce a real book as Oulton
was to become. Richard Ford hit the nail on the head when he said with
quite wonderful prescience:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How I wish you had given us more about yourself, instead of the
extracts from those blunder-headed old Spaniards, who knew
nothing about gypsies! I shall give you the <i>rap</i>, on that, and
a hint to publish your whole adventures for the last twenty
years.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></div>

<p>Henceforth Borrow was to write about himself and to become a great
author in consequence. For in writing about himself as in <i>Lavengro</i> and
<i>The Romany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> Rye</i> he was to write exactly as he felt about the gypsies,
and to throw over them the glamour of his own point of view, the view of
a man who loved the broad highway and those who sojourned upon it. In
<i>The Gypsies of Spain</i> we have a conventional estimate of the gypsies.
'There can be no doubt that they are human beings and have immortal
souls,' he says, even as if he were writing a letter to the Bible
Society. All his anecdotes about the gypsies are unfavourable to them,
suggestive only of them as knaves and cheats. From these pictures it is
a far cry to the creation of Jasper Petulengro and Isopel Berners. The
most noteworthy figure in <i>The Zincali</i> is the gypsy soldier of
Valdepe&ntilde;as, an unholy rascal. 'To lie, to steal, to shed human
blood'&mdash;these are the most marked characteristics with which Borrow
endows the gypsies of Spain. 'Abject and vile as they have ever been,
the git&aacute;nos have nevertheless found admirers in Spain,' says the author
who came to be popularly recognised as the most enthusiastic admirer of
the gypsies in Spain and elsewhere. Read to-day by the lover of Borrow's
other books <i>The Zincali</i> will be pronounced a readable collection of
anecdotes, interspersed with much dull matter, with here and there a
piece of admirable writing. But the book would scarcely have lived had
it not been followed by four works of so fine an individuality. Well
might Ford ask Borrow for more about himself and less of the extracts
from 'blunder-headed old Spaniards.' When Borrow came to write about
himself he revealed his real kindness for the gypsy folk. He gave us
Jasper Petulengro and the incomparable description of 'the wind on the
heath.' He kindled the imagination of men, proclaimed the joys of
vagabondage in a manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> that thrilled many hearts. He had some
predecessors and many successors, but 'none could then, or can ever
again,' says the biographer of a later Rye, 'see or hear of Romanies
without thinking of Borrow.'<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> In her biography of one of these
successors in gypsy lore, Charles Godfrey Leland, Mrs. Pennell discusses
the probability that Borrow and Leland met in the British Museum. That
is admitted in a letter from Leland to Borrow in my possession. To this
letter Borrow made no reply. It was wrong of him. But he was then&mdash;in
1873&mdash;a prematurely old man, worn out and saddened by neglect and a
sense of literary failure. For this and for the other vagaries of those
latter years Borrow will not be judged harshly by those who read his
story here. Nothing could be more courteous than Borrow's one letter to
Leland, written in the failing handwriting&mdash;once so excellent&mdash;of the
last sad decade of his life:</p>

<p>The meeting did not, through Leland's absence from London, then take
place. Two years later it was another story. The failing powers were
more noteworthy. Borrow was by this time dead to the world, as the
documents before me abundantly testify. It is not, therefore, necessary
to assume, as Leland's friends have all done, that Borrow never replied
because he was on the eve of publishing a book of his own about the
gypsies. There seems no reason to assume, as Dr. Knapp does and as
Leland does, that this was the reason for the unanswered letter:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Langham Hotel, Portland Place</span>, <i>March 31st, 1873.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I sincerely trust that the limited extent of our
acquaintanceship will not cause this note to seem to you too
presuming. <i>Breviter</i>, I have thrown the results of my
observations among English gypsies into a very unpretending
little volume consisting almost entirely of facts gathered from
the Romany, without any theory. As I owe all my interest in the
subject to your writings, and as I am sincerely grateful to you
for the impulse which they gave me, I should like very much to
dedicate my book to you. Of course if your kindness permits I
shall submit the proofs to you, that you may judge whether the
work deserves the honour. I should have sent you the MS., but
not long after our meeting at the British Museum I left for
Egypt, whence I have very recently returned, to find my
publisher clamorous for the promised copy.</p>

<p>It is <i>not</i>&mdash;God knows&mdash;a mean and selfish desire to help my
book by giving it the authority of your name, which induces
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> request. But I am earnestly desirous for my conscience'
sake to publish nothing in the Romany which shall not be true
and sensible, even as all that you have written is true and
sensible. Therefore, <i>should</i> you take the pains to glance over
my proof, I should be grateful if you would signify to me any
differences of opinion should there be ground for any. Dr. A.
F. Pott in his <i>Zigeuner</i> (vol. ii. p. 224), intimates very
decidedly that you took the word <i>shastr</i> (Exhastra de Moyses)
from Sanskrit and put it into Romany; declaring that it would
be very important if <i>shaster</i> were Romany. I mention in my
book that English gypsies call the New Testament (also any MS.)
a <i>shaster</i>, and that a betting-book on a racecourse is called
a <i>shaster</i> 'because it is written.' I do not pretend in my
book to such deep Romany as you have achieved&mdash;all that I claim
is to have collected certain words, facts, phrases, etc., out
of the Romany of the roads&mdash;corrupt as it is&mdash;as I have found
it to-day. I deal only with the gypsy of the <i>Decadence</i>. With
renewed apology for intrusion should it seem such, I remain,
yours very respectfully,</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Charles G. Leland.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>Francis Hindes Groome remarked when reviewing Borrow's <i>Word Book</i> in
1874,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> that when <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i> was published in 1841 'there
were not two educated men in England who possessed the slightest
knowledge of Romany.' In the intervening thirty-three years all this was
changed. There was an army of gypsy scholars or scholar gypsies of whom
Leland was one, Hindes Groome another, and Professor E. H. Palmer a
third, to say nothing of many scholars and students of Romany in other
lands. Not one of them seemed when Borrow published his <i>Word Book of
the Romany</i> to see that he was the only man of genius among them. They
only saw that he was an inferior philologist to them all. And so Borrow,
who prided himself on things that he could do indifferently quite as
much as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> upon things that he could do well, suffered once again, as he
was so often doomed to suffer, from the lack of appreciation which was
all in all to him, and his career went out in a veritable blizzard. He
published nothing after his <i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i> appeared in 1874.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> He
was then indeed a broken and a bitter man, with no further interest in
life. Dedications of books to him interested him not at all. In any
other mood, or a few years earlier, Leland's book, <i>The English
Gypsies</i>,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> would have gladdened his heart. In his preface Leland
expresses 'the highest respect for the labours of Mr. George Borrow in
this field,' he quotes Borrow continually and with sympathy, and renders
him honour as a philologist, that has usually been withheld. 'To Mr.
Borrow is due the discovery that the word <i>Jockey</i> is of gypsy origin
and derived from <i>chuckiri</i>, which means a whip,' and he credits Borrow
with the discovery of the origin of 'tanner' for sixpence; he vindicates
him as against Dr. A. F. Pott,&mdash;a prince among students of gypsydom&mdash;of
being the first to discover that the English gypsies call the Bible the
<i>Shaster</i>. But there is a wealth of scientific detail in Leland's books
that is not to be found in Borrow's, as also there is in Francis Hindes
Groome's works. What had Borrow to do with science? He could not even
give the word 'R&uacute;mani' its accent, and called it 'Romany.' He 'quietly
appropriated,' says Groome, 'Bright's Spanish gypsy words for his own
work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> mistakes and all, without one word of recognition. I think one
has the ancient impostor there.'<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> 'His knowledge of the strange
history of the gypsies was very elementary, of their manners almost more
so, and of their folk-lore practically <i>nil</i>,' says Groome
elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Yet Mr. Hindes Groome readily acknowledges that Borrow
is above all writers on the gypsies. 'He communicates a subtle insight
into gypsydom'&mdash;that is the very essence of the matter.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Controversy
will continue in the future as in the present as to whether the gypsies
are all that Borrow thought them. Perhaps 'corruption has crept in among
them' as it did with the prize-fighters. They have intermarried with the
gorgios, thrown over their ancient customs, lost all their picturesque
qualities, it may be. But Borrow has preserved in literature for all
time, as not one of the philologists and folk-lore students has done, a
remarkable type of people. But this is not to be found in his first
original work, <i>The Zincali</i>, nor in his last, <i>The Romano Lavo-Lil</i>.
This glamour is to be found in <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany Rye</i>, to which
books we shall come in due course. Here we need only refer to the fact
that Borrow had loved the gypsies all his life&mdash;from his boyish meeting
with Petulengro until in advancing years the prototype of that wonderful
creation of his imagination&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> this the Petulengro of <i>Lavengro</i>
undoubtedly was&mdash;came to visit him at Oulton. Well might Leland call him
'the Nestor of Gypsydom.'</p>

<p>We find the following letter to Dr. Bowring accompanying a copy of <i>The
Zincali</i>:</p>


<h3>To Dr. John Bowring.</h3>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have sent you a copy of my work by the mail. If
you could contrive to notice it some way or other I should feel
much obliged. Murray has already sent copies to all the
journals. It is needless to tell you that despatch in these
matters is very important, the first blow is everything. Lord
Clarendon is out of town. So I must send him his presentation
copy through Murray, and then write to him. I am very unwell,

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>Two years later we find Borrow writing to an unknown correspondent upon
a phase of folk-lore:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Oulton, Lowestoft, Suffolk</span>, <i>August 11, 1843.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your interesting and kind letter
in which you do me the honour to ask my opinion respecting the
pedigree of your island goblin, le feu follet Belenger; that
opinion I cheerfully give with a premise that it is only an
opinion; in hunting for the etymons of these fairy names we can
scarcely expect to arrive at anything like certainty.</p>

<p>I suppose you are aware that the name of Bilenger or Billinger
is of occasional though by no means of frequent occurrence both
in England and France. I have seen it; you have heard of
Billings-gate and of Billingham, the unfortunate assassin of
poor Percival,&mdash;all modifications of the same root; Belingart,
Bilings home or Billing ston. But what is Billin-ger? Clearly
that which is connected in some way or other with Billing. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
will find <i>ger</i>, or something like it, in most
European-tongues&mdash;Boulan<i>ger</i>, horolo<i>ger</i>, tal<i>ker</i>, walk<i>er</i>,
ba<i>ker</i>, bre<i>wer</i>, beg<i>gar</i>. In Welsh it is of frequent
occurrence in the shape of <i>ur</i> or <i>gwr</i>&mdash;hen<i>ur</i> (an eld<i>er</i>),
her<i>wr</i> (a prow<i>ler</i>); in Russian the ger, gwr, ur, er, appears
in the shape of <i>ik</i> or <i>k</i>&mdash;sapojgn<i>ik</i>, a shoema<i>ker</i>,
Chinobu<i>ik</i>, a man possessed of rank. The root of all these, as
well as of <i>or</i> in senator, victor, etc., is the Sanscrit <i>ker</i>
or <i>kir</i>, which means lord, master, maker, doer, possessor of
something or connected with something.</p>

<p>We want now to come at the meaning of Beling or Billing, which
probably means some action, or some moral or personal
attribute; Bolvile in Anglo-Saxon means honest, Danish Bollig;
Wallen, in German, to wanken or move restlessly about; Baylan,
in Spanish, to dance (Ball? Ballet?), connected with which are
to whirl, to fling, and possibly Belinger therefore may mean a
Billiger or honest fellow, or it may mean a Walter<i>ger</i>, a
whirl<i>enger</i>, a flinger, or something connected with restless
motion.</p>

<p>Allow me to draw your attention to the word 'Will' in the
English word will-o-the-wisp; it must not be supposed that this
Will is the abbreviation of William; it is pure Danish,
'Vild'&mdash;pronounced will,&mdash;and signifies wild; Vilden Visk, the
wild or moving wisp. I can adduce another instance of the
corruption of the Danish vild into will: the rustics of this
part of England are in the habit of saying 'they are led will'
(vild or wild) when from intoxication or some other cause they
are bewildered at night and cannot find their way home. This
expression is clearly from the old Norse or Danish. I am not at
all certain that 'Bil' in Bilinger may not be this same will or
vild, and that the word may not be a corruption of vilden, old
or elder, wild or flying fire. It has likewise occurred to me
that Bilinger may be derived from 'Volundr,' the worship of the
blacksmith or Northern Vulcan. Your obedient servant,</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3><i>THE BIBLE IN SPAIN</i></h3>


<p>In an admirable appreciation of our author, the one in which he gives
the oft-quoted eulogy concerning him as 'the delightful, the bewitching,
the never-sufficiently-to-be-praised George Borrow,' Mr. Birrell records
the solace that may be found by small boys in the ambiguities of a
title-page, or at least might have been found in it in his youth and in
mine. In those days in certain Puritan circles a very strong line was
drawn between what was known as Sunday reading, and reading that might
be permitted on week-days. The Sunday book must have a religious
flavour. There were magazines with that particular flavour, every story
in them having a pious moral withal. Very closely watched and
scrutinised was the reading of young people in those days and in those
circles. Mr. Birrell, doubtless, speaks from autobiographical memories
when he tells us of a small boy with whose friends <i>The Bible in Spain</i>
passed muster on the strength of its title-page. For Mr. Birrell is the
son of a venerated Nonconformist minister; and perhaps he, or at least
those who were of his household, had this religious idiosyncrasy. It may
be that the distinction which pervaded the evangelical circles of Mr.
Birrell's youth as to what were Sunday books, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> distinct from books to
be read on week-days, has disappeared. In any case think of the
advantage of the boy of that generation who was able to handle a book
with so unexceptionable a title as <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. His elders
would succumb at once, particularly if the boy had the good sense to
call their attention to the sub-title&mdash;'The Journeys, Adventures, and
Imprisonments of an Englishman in an Attempt to Circulate the Scriptures
in the Peninsula.' Nothing could be said by the most devout of seniors
against so prepossessing a title-page.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But what of the boy who had
thus passed the censorship? What a revelation of adventure was open to
him! Perhaps he would skip the 'preachy' parts in which Borrow was
doubtless sincere, although the sincerity has so uncertain a ring
to-day. Here are five passages, for example, which do not seem to belong
to the book:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In whatever part of the world I, a poor wanderer in the
Gospel's cause, may chance to be</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>very possibly the fate of St. Stephen might overtake me; but
does the man deserve the name of a follower of Christ who would
shrink from danger of any kind in the cause of Him whom he
calls his Master? 'He who loses his life for my sake shall find
it,' are words which the Lord Himself uttered. These words were
fraught with consolation to me, as they doubtless are to every
one engaged in propagating the Gospel, in sincerity of heart,
in savage and barbarian lands.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Unhappy land! not until the pure light of the Gospel has
illumined thee, wilt thou learn that the greatest of all gifts
is charity!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>and I thought that to convey the Gospel to a place so wild and
remote might perhaps be considered an acceptable pilgrimage in
the eyes of my Maker. True it is that but one copy remained of
those which I had brought with me on this last journey; but
this reflection, far from discouraging me in my projected
enterprise, produced the contrary effect, as I called to mind
that, ever since the Lord revealed Himself to man, it has
seemed good to Him to accomplish the greatest ends by
apparently the most insufficient means; and I reflected that
this one copy might serve as an instrument for more good than
the four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine copies of the
edition of Madrid.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I shall not detain the course of my narrative with reflections
as to the state of a Church which, though it pretends to be
founded on scripture, would yet keep the light of scripture
from all mankind, if possible. But Rome is fully aware that she
is not a Christian Church, and having no desire to become so,
she acts prudently in keeping from the eyes of her followers
the page which would reveal to them the truths of Christianity.</p></div>

<p>All this does not ring quite true, and in any case it is too much on the
lines of 'Sunday reading' to please the small boy, who must, however,
have found a thousand things in that volume that were to his taste&mdash;some
of the wildest adventures, hairbreadth escapes, extraordinary meetings
again and again with unique people&mdash;with Benedict Mol, for example, who
was always seeking for treasure. Gypsies, bull-fighters, quaint and
queer characters of every kind, come before us in rapid succession.
Rarely, surely, have so many adventures been crowded into the same
number of pages. Only when Borrow remembers, as he has to do
occasionally, that he is an agent of the Bible Society does the book
lose its vigour and its charm. We have already pointed out that the
foundations of the volume were contained in certain letters written by
Borrow during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> his five years in Spain to the secretaries of the Bible
Society in London. The recent publication of these letters has revealed
to us Borrow's methods. When he had settled down at Oulton he took down
his notebooks, one of which is before me, but finding this was not
sufficient, he asked the Bible Society for the loan of his letters to
them.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Other letters that he hoped to use were not forthcoming, as
the following note from Miss Gurney to Mrs. Borrow indicates:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Earlham</span>, <i>12th June 1840.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Borrow</span>,&mdash;I am sorry I cannot find any of Mr. Borrow's
letters from Spain. I don't think we ever had any, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> my
brother is from home and I therefore cannot inquire of him. I
send you the only two I can find. I am very glad he is going to
publish his travels, which I have no doubt will be very
interesting. It must be a pleasant object to assist him by
copying the manuscripts. If I should visit Lowestoft this
summer I shall hope to see you, but I have no immediate
prospect of doing so. With kind regards to all your party, I
am, Dear Mrs. Borrow, Yours sincerely,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">C. Gurney.</span><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>The Bible Society applied to in the same manner lent Borrow all his
letters to that organisation and its secretaries. Not all were returned.
Many came to Dr. Knapp when he purchased the half of the Borrow papers
that were sold after Borrow's death; the remainder are in my possession.
It is a nice point, seventy years after they were written, as to whom
they belong. In any case the Bible Society must have kept copies of
everything, for when, in 1911, they came to publish the <i>Letters</i><a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
the collection was sufficiently complete. That publication revealed some
interesting sidelights. It proved on the one hand that Borrow had drawn
more upon his diaries than upon his letters, although he frequently
reproduced fragments of his diaries in his letters. It revealed further
the extraordinary frankness with which Borrow wrote to his employers.
But the main point is in the discovery revealed to us that Borrow was
not an artist in his letters. Borrow was never a good letter writer,
although I think that many of the letters that appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> for the first
time in these pages will prove that his letters are very interesting as
contributions to biography. If some of the letters that helped to make
up <i>The Bible in Spain</i> are interesting, it is because in them Borrow
incorporated considerable fragments of anecdote and adventure from his
notebooks. It is quite a mistake to assume, as does Dr. Knapp, that the
'Rev. and Dear Sir' at the head of a letter was the only variation. You
will look in vain in the Bible Society correspondence for many a pearl
that is contained in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, and you will look in vain in
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> for many a sentence which concludes some of the
original letters. In one case, indeed, a letter concludes with Heber's
hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>with which Borrow's correspondent must already have been sufficiently
familiar. But Borrow could not be other than Borrow, and the secretaries
of the Bible Society had plentiful matter with which to astonish them.
The finished production, however, is a fascinating book. You read it
again and it becomes still more entertaining. No wonder that it took the
world by storm and made its author the lion of a season. 'A queer book
will be this same <i>Bible in Spain</i>,' wrote Borrow to John Murray in
August 1841, 'containing all my queer adventures in that queer country
... it will make two nice foolscap octavo volumes.'<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> It actually
made three volumes, and Borrow was as irritated at Mr. Murray's delay in
publishing as that publisher afterwards became at Borrow's own delay
over <i>Lavengro</i>. The whole book was laboriously copied out by Mrs.
Borrow. When this copy was sent to Mr. Murray, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> was submitted to his
'reader,' who reported 'numerous faults in spelling and some in
grammar,' to which criticism Borrow retorted that the copy was the work
of 'a country amanuensis.' The book was published in December 1842, but
has the date 1843 on its title-page.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In its three-volumed form 4750
copies of the book were issued by July 1843, after which countless
copies were sold in cheaper one-volumed form. Success had at last come
to Borrow. He was one of the most talked-of writers of the day. His
elation may be demonstrated by his discussion with Dawson Turner as to
whether he should leave the manuscript of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> to the
Dean and Chapter's Library at Norwich or to the British Museum, by his
gratification at the fact that Sir Robert Peel referred to his book in
the House of Commons, and by his pleasure in the many appreciative
reviews which, indeed, were for the most part all that an ambitious
author could desire. 'Never,' said <i>The Examiner</i>, 'was book more
legibly impressed with the unmistakable mark of genius.' 'There is no
taking leave of a book like this,' said the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>. 'Better
Christmas fare we have never had it in our power to offer our readers.'</p>

<p>The publication of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> made Borrow famous for a time.
Hitherto he had been known only to a small religious community, the
coterie that ran the Bible Society. Even the large mass of people who
subscribed to that Society knew its agent in Spain only by meagre
allusions in the Annual Reports. Now the world was to talk about him,
and he enjoyed being talked about. Borrow declared&mdash;in 1842&mdash;that the
five years he passed in Spain were the most happy years of his
existence. But then he had not had a happy life during the previous
years, as we have seen, and in Russia he had a toilsome task with an
added element of uncertainty as to the permanence of his position. The
five years in Spain had plentiful adventure, and they closed in a
pleasant manner. Yet the year that followed, even though it found him
almost a country squire, was not a happy one. Once again the world did
not want him and his books&mdash;not the <i>Gypsies of Spain</i> for example.
Seven weeks after publication it had sold only to the extent of some
three hundred copies.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But the happiest year of Borrow's life was
undoubtedly the one that followed the publication of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>. Up to that time he had been a mere adventurer; now he was that
most joyous of beings&mdash;a successful author; and here, from among his
Papers, is a carefully preserved relic of his social triumph:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

taste. They hoped to have met him last night at the Bishop of
Norwich's, but arrived there too late. They had already
commissioned Lady Hall (sister to Madam Bunsen) to express to
Mr. Borrow their wish for his acquaintance.</p></div>

<p>In a letter to his wife, of which a few lines are printed in Dr. Knapp's
book, he also writes of this visit to the Prussian Minister, where he
had for company 'Princes and Members of Parliament.' 'I was the star of

To-morrow I dine with an old schoolfellow. Murray is talking of
printing a new edition to sell for five shillings: those
rascals, the Americans, have, it seems, reprinted it, and are
selling it for <i>eighteen</i> pence. Murray says he shall print ten
thousand copies; it is chiefly wanted for the Colonies. He says
the rich people and the libraries have already got it, and he
is quite right, for nearly three thousand copies have been sold
at 27s.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> There is no longer the high profit to be made on

ones, and in the present state of copyright there is no help;
we can, however, keep the American edition out of the Colonies,
which is something. I have nothing more to say save to commend
you not to go on the water without me; perhaps you would be
overset; and do not go on the bridge again till I come. Take

<p>The earliest literary efforts of Borrow in Spain were his two

Basque. This last book he did not actually translate himself, but
procured 'from a Basque physician of the name of Oteiza.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

ever laboured under, giving, as it does, the idea that the book is a
prolonged tract.'</p></div>

Spain. The 'notebook' contained many of his adventures, and moreover on
August 20, 1836, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, published two long letters from him
under the title of 'The Gypsies in Russia and in Spain,' opening with
the following preliminary announcement:
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have been obligingly favoured with the following extracts
from letters of an intelligent gentleman, whose literary
labours, the least important of his life, we not long since
highly praised, but whose name we are not at liberty, on this
occasion, to make public. They contain some curious and
interesting facts relating to the condition of this peculiar
people in very distant countries.</p></div>
<p>
The first letter is dated September 23, 1835, and gives an account of
his experiences with the gypsies in Russia. The whole of this account he
incorporated in <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>. Following this there are two
columns, dated Madrid, July 19, 1836, in which he gives an account of
the gypsies in Spain. All the episodes that he relates he incorporated
in <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. The two letters so plainly indicate that all
the time Borrow was in Spain his mind was more filled with the subject
of the gypsies than with any other question. He did his work well for
the Bible Society no doubt, and gave them their money's worth, but there
is a humorous note in the fact that Borrow should have utilised his
position as a missionary&mdash;for so we must count him&mdash;to make himself so
thoroughly acquainted with gypsy folklore and gypsy songs and dances as
these two fragments by an 'intelligent gentleman' imply. It is not
strange that under the circumstances Borrow did not wish that his name
should be made public.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>RICHARD FORD</h3>


<p>The most distinguished of Borrow's friends in the years that succeeded
his return from Spain was Richard Ford, whose interests were so largely
wrapped-up in the story of that country. Ford was possessed of a very
interesting personality, which was not revealed to the public until Mr.
Rowland E. Prothero issued his excellent biography<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> in 1905,
although Ford died in 1858. This delay is the more astonishing as Ford's
<i>Handbook for Travellers in Spain</i> was one of the most famous books of
its day. Ford's father, Sir Richard Ford, was a friend of William Pitt,
and twice sat in Parliament, being at one time Under-Secretary of State
for the Home Department. He ended his official career as a police
magistrate at Bow Street, but deserves to be better known to fame as the
creator of the mounted police force of London. Ford was born with a
silver spoon in his mouth, inheriting a fortune from his father, and
from his mother an extraordinary taste for art. Although called to the
bar he never practised, but spent his time in travelling on the
Continent, building up a valuable collection of books and paintings. He
was three times married, and all these unions seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> have been happy,
in spite of an almost unpleasant celerity in the second alliance, which
took place nine months after the death of his first wife. A very large
portion of his life he devoted to Spain, which he knew so intimately
that in 1845 he produced that remarkable <i>Handbook</i> in two closely
printed volumes, a most repellent-looking book in appearance to those
who are used to contemporary typography, usually so attractive. Ford, in
fact, was so full of his subject that instead of a handbook he wrote a
work which ought to have appeared in half a dozen volumes. In later
editions the book was condensed into one of Mr. Murray's usual
guide-books, but the curious may still enjoy the work in its earliest
form, so rich in discussions of the Spanish people, their art and
architecture, their history and their habits. The greater part of the
letters in Mr. Prothero's collection are addressed to Addington, who was
our ambassador to Madrid for some years, until he was superseded by
George Villiers, Lord Clarendon, with whom Borrow came so much in
contact. Those letters reveal a remarkably cultivated mind and an
interesting outlook on life, an outlook that was always intensely
anti-democratic. It is impossible to sympathise with him in his brutal
reference to the execution by the Spaniards of Robert Boyd, a young
Irishman who was captured with Torrijos by the Spanish Government in
1831. Richard Ford apparently left Spain very shortly before George
Borrow entered that country. Ford passed through Madrid on his way to
England in September 1833. He then settled near Exeter, purchasing an
Elizabethan cottage called Heavitree House, with twelve acres of land,
and devoted himself to turning it into a beautiful mansion. Presumably
he first met Borrow in Mr. John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> Murray's famous drawing-room soon after
the publication of <i>The Gypsies of Spain</i>. He tells Addington, indeed,
in a letter of 14th January 1841:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have made acquaintance with an extraordinary fellow, George
Borrow, who went out to Spain to convert the gypsies. He is
about to publish his failure, and a curious book it will be. It
was submitted to my perusal by the hesitating Murray.</p></div>

<p>Ford's article upon Borrow's book appeared in <i>The British and Foreign
Review</i>, and Ford was delighted that the book had created a sensation,
and that he had given sound advice as to publishing the manuscript. When
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> was ready, Ford was one of the first to read it.
Then he wrote to John Murray:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I read Borrow with great delight all the way down per rail. You
may depend upon it that the book will sell, which after all is
the rub.</p></div>

<p>And in that letter Ford describes the book as putting him in mind of Gil
Blas with 'a touch of Bunyan.' Lockhart himself reviewed the book in
<i>The Quarterly</i>, so Ford had to go to the rival organ&mdash;<i>The Edinburgh
Review</i>&mdash;receiving &pound;44 for the article, which sum, he tells us, he
invested in Ch&acirc;teau Margaux.</p>

<p>Ford's first letter to Borrow in my collection is written in Spanish:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Batuschca Borrow</span>,&mdash;I am glad that the paper pleased you, and I
think it calculated to promote the sale, which a too copious
extracting article does not always do, as people think that
they have had the cream. Napier sent me &pound;44 for the thirty-two
pages; this, with Kemble's &pound;50, 8s. for the <i>Zincali</i>, nearly
reaches &pound;100: I lay it out in claret, being not amiss to do in
the world, and richer by many hundreds a year than last year,
but with a son at Eton and daughters coming out, and an
overgrown set of servants, money is never to be despised, and I
find that expenditure by some infernal principle has a greater
tendency to increase than income, and that when the latter
increases it never does so in the ratio of the former&mdash;enough
of that. How to write an article without being
condensed&mdash;epigrammatical and <i>epitomical cream-skimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> that
is</i>&mdash;I know not, one has so much to say and so little space to
say it in.</p>

<p>I rejoice to hear of your meditated biography; really I am your
wet nurse, and you ought to dedicate it to me; take time, but
not too much; avoid all attempts to write fine; just dash down
the first genuine uppouring idea and thoughts in the plainest
language and that which comes first, and then fine it and
compress it. Let us have a glossary; for people cry out for a
Dragoman, and half your local gusto evaporates.</p>

meagre profits spring from pen and ink; but Cervantes died a
beggar and is immortal. It is the devil who comes into the

that it is cash down which makes the mare to go; dollars will
add spurs even to the Prince of Mustard's paces.</p>

<p>It is a bore not receiving even the crumbs which drop from such
tables as those spread by Mr. Eyre: Murray, however, is a deep
cove, <i>y muy pratico en cosas de libreteria</i>: and he knew that
the <i>first out</i> about Afghan would sell prodigiously. I doubt
now if Lady Sale would now be such a general Sale. Murray
builds solid castles in Eyre. Los de Espa&ntilde;a rezalo bene de ser

<p>I had nothing to do whatever with the <i>manner</i> in which the
handbook puff was affixed to your book. I wrote the said paper,
but concluded that Murray would put it, as usual, in the
fly-leaf of the book, as he does in his others, and the <i>Q.

<p>During these years&mdash;1843 and onwards&mdash;Borrow was regularly corresponding
with Ford. I quote a sentence from one of these letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Borrow writes me word that his Life is nearly ready, and it
will run the Bible hull down. If he tells truth it will be a
queer thing. I shall review it for <i>The Edinburgh</i>.</p></div>

<p>This speech of Peel's in the House of Commons, in which in reply to a
very trivial question by Dr. Bowring, then M.P. for Bolton, upon the
subject of the correspondence of the British Government with Turkey, the
great statesman urged:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It might have been said to Mr. Borrow, with respect to Spain,
that it would be impossible to distribute the Bible in that
country in consequence of the danger of offending the
prejudices which prevail there; yet he, a private individual,
by showing some zeal in what he believed to be right, succeeded
in triumphing over many obstacles.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p></div>

<p>Borrow was elated with the compliment, and asked Mr. Murray two months
later if he could not advertise the eulogium with one of his books.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>In June 1844, while the <i>Handbook for Travellers in Spain</i> was going to
press, Ford went on a visit to Borrow at Oulton, and describes the pair
as 'two rum coves in a queer country'; and further gives one of the best
descriptions of the place:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His house hangs over a lonely lake covered with wild fowl, and
is girt with dark firs through which the wind sighs sadly.</p></div>

<p>When the <i>Handbook for Travellers in Spain</i> was published in 1845 it was
agreed that Borrow should write the review for <i>The Quarterly</i>. Instead
of writing a review Borrow, possessed by that tactlessness which so
frequently overcame him, wrote an article on 'Spain and the Spaniards,'
very largely of abuse, an absolutely useless production from the point
of view of Ford the author, and of Lockhart, his editor friend. Borrow
never forgave Lockhart for returning this manuscript, but that it had no
effect on Ford's friendship is shown by the following letter, dated 1846
(p. 258), written long after the unfortunate episode, and another in Dr.
Knapp's <i>Life</i>, dated 1851:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. Borrow, Oulton Hall, Lowestoft.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Oct. 6, 1844</i>, <span class="smcap">Cheltenham</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I trouble you with a line to say that I have
received a letter from Don Jorge, from Constantinople. He
evidently is now anxious to be quietly back again on the banks
of your peaceful lake; he speaks favourably of his health,
which has been braced up by change of air, scenery, and
occupations, so I hope he will get through next winter without
any bronchitis, and go on with his own biography.</p>

<p>He asks me when <i>Handbook</i> will be done? Please to tell him
that it is done and printing, but that it runs double the
length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> which was contemplated: however, it will be a <i>queer</i>
book, and tell him that we reserve it until his return to

place and making for my home at Hevitre, where we trust to
arrive next Thursday.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;<i>El hombre propose pero Dios es que dispose.</i> I
had hope to have run down and seen you and yours in your quiet
Patmos; but the Sangrados will it otherwise. I have never been
quite free from a tickling pain since the bronchitis of last
year, and it has recently assumed the form of extreme
relaxation and irritation in the uvula, which is that pendulous
appendage which hangs over the orifice of the throat. Mine has
become so seriously elongated that, after submitting for four
days last week to its being burnt with caustic every morning in
the hopes that it might thus crimp and contract itself, I have
been obliged to have it amputated. This has left a great
soreness, which militates against talking and deglutition, and
would render our charming chats after the Madeira over la
cheminea del <i>cueldo</i> inadvisable. I therefore defer the visit:
my Sangrado recommends me, when the summer advances, to fly
away into change of air, change of scene; in short, must seek
an <i>hejira</i> as you made. How strange the coincidence! but those
who have wandered much about require periodical migration, as
the encaged quail twice a year beats its breast against the
wires.</p>

<p>I am not quite determined where to go, whether to Scotland and
the sweet heath-aired hills, or to the wild rocks and clear
trout streams of the Tyrol; it is a question between the gun
and the rod. If I go north assuredly si Dios quiere I will take
your friendly and peaceful abode in my way.</p>

<p>As to my immediate plans I can say nothing before Thursday,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
when the Sangrado is to report on some diagnosis which he
expects.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <i>Handbook</i> is all but out, and Lockhart and Murray
are eager to have you in the <i>Q. R.</i> I enclose you a note from
the editor. How feel you inclined? I would send you down 30
sheets, and you might run your eye through them. <i>There are
plums in the pudding.</i></p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Richard Ford.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>A proof in slip form of the rejected review, with Borrow's corrections
written upon it, is in my possession. Our author pictures Gibraltar as a
human entity thus addressing Spain:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Accursed land! I hate thee, and far from being a defence, will
invariably prove a thorn in thy side.</p></div>

<p>And so on through many sentences of excited rhetoric. Borrow forgot
while he wrote that he had a book to review&mdash;a book, moreover, issued by
the publishing house which issued the periodical in which his review was
to appear. And this book was a book in ten thousand&mdash;a veritable mine of
information and out of the way learning. Surely this slight reference
amid many dissertations of his own upon Spain was to damn his friend's
book with faint praise:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Handbook is a Handbook after all, a very useful thing, but
still&mdash;the fact is that we live in an age of humbug, in which
everything, to obtain note and reputation, must depend less
upon its own intrinsic merit than on the name it bears. The
present book is about one of the best books ever written upon
Spain; but we are afraid that it will never be estimated at its
proper value; for after all a Handbook is a Handbook.</p></div>

<p>Yet successful as was Ford's <i>Handbook</i>, it is doubtful but that Borrow
was right in saying that it had better have been called <i>Wanderings in
Spain</i> or <i>Wonders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> of the Peninsula</i>. How much more gracious was the
statement of another great authority on Spain&mdash;Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell&mdash;who said that 'so great a literary achievement had
never before been performed under so humble a title.' The article,
however, furnishes a trace of autobiography in the statement by Borrow
that he had long been in the habit of reading <i>Don Quixote</i> once every
nine years. Yet he tells us that he prefers Le Sage's <i>Gil Blas</i> to <i>Don
Quixote</i>, 'the characters introduced being certainly more true to
nature.' But altogether we do not wonder that Lockhart declined to
publish the article. Here is the last letter in my possession; after
this there is one in the Knapp collection dated 1851, acknowledging a
copy of <i>Lavengro</i>, in which Ford adds: 'Mind when you come to see the
Exhibition you look in here, for I long to have a chat,' and so the
friendship appears to have collapsed as so many friendships do. Ford
died at Heavitree in 1858:</p>

Zincali! They have managed to make good money&mdash;I always thought Messrs.
M. very decent people, it usually happens that those who have much to do
with good class of people become themselves somewhat large-minded and
liberal. You must admit that I am a model critic, and that I cry, 'Luck
to the Books' Full well do I know how you thank the most noble and
illustrious public! Go ahead, therefore, and leave nothing forgotten in
the ink-pot; but by all that is holy, shun the Spanish historians, who
are liars and fools! I regret very much that you should have left
London; I leave here on Saturday with the intention of paying a visit of
about three weeks to the maternal home, as is my custom in the month of
the Christmas boxes. Very much would I have liked to see you and discuss
with you about things of Spain and other gypsy lore and fancy topics,
but of which at present nothing do I understand. I shall not fail to
take with me the papers and documents which you kindly sent me to
Cheltenham. I will make them into a parcel and leave them with Messrs.
Murray, so that you can send for them whenever you like. I shall do my
best to penetrate those mysteries and that strange people. Mr. Murray,
junior, writes in a pleased tone respecting <i>The Bible in Spain</i>. I
should like to write an article on a subject so full of interest.
Possibly my article on the gypsies will appear in the next number, and
in such case it will prove more useful to you than if it appeared now.
The life and memory of reviews are very short. They appear like
butterflies, and die in a day. The dead and the departed have no
friends. The living to the feast, the dead to the grave. No sooner does
a new number appear than the last one is already forgotten and joins the
things of the past. What do you think? At a party recently in which a
drawing was held, I drew the <i>Krallis de los Zincali</i>. I beg to enclose
the table (or index) for your Majesty's guidance; really, I must have in
my veins a few drops of the genuine wanderer. Mr. Gagargos has been just
appointed Spanish Consul in Tunis, where he will not lack means for
progressing in the Arabic language and literature.&mdash;Yours, etc.,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>IN EASTERN EUROPE</h3>


<p>In 1844 Borrow set out for the most distant holiday that he was ever to
undertake. Passing through London in March 1844, he came under the
critical eye of Elizabeth Rigby, afterwards Lady Eastlake, that
formidable critic who four years later&mdash;in 1848&mdash;wrote the cruel review
of <i>Jane Eyre</i> in <i>The Quarterly</i> that gave so much pain to Charlotte
Bront&euml;. She was not a nice woman. These sharp, 'clever' women-critics
rarely are; and Borrow never made a pleasant impression when such women
came across his path&mdash;instance Harriet Martineau, Frances Cobbe, and
Agnes Strickland. We should sympathise with him, and not count it for a
limitation, as some of his biographers have done. The future Lady
Eastlake thus disposes of Borrow in her one reference to him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>March 20.</i>&mdash;Borrow came in the evening; now a fine man, but a
most disagreeable one; a kind of character that would be most
dangerous in rebellious times&mdash;one that would suffer or
persecute to the utmost. His face is expressive of
strong-headed determination.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p></div>

<p>Quoting this description of Borrow, Dr. Knapp describes it as
'shallow'&mdash;for 'he was one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> kindest of men, as my documents
show.' The description is shallow enough, because the writer had no kind
of comprehension of Borrow, but then, perhaps, his champion had not.
Borrow was neither one of the 'kindest of men' nor the reverse. He was a
good hater and a whole-hearted lover, and to be thus is to fill a
certain uncomfortable but not discreditable place in the scheme of
things. About a month later Borrow was on the way to the East,
travelling by Paris and Vienna. From Paris he wrote to Mr. John Murray
that Vidocq 'wished much to have a copy of my <i>Gypsies in Spain</i>,' but
suspects the Frenchman of desiring to produce a compressed translation.
Will Mr. Murray have the book translated into French? he asks, and so
circumvent his wily friend.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In June he is in Buda Pesth, whence he
wrote to his wife:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, Oulton, Lowestoft</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Pesth, Hungary</span>, <i>14th June 1844.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;I was so glad to get your letter which
reached me about nine days ago; on receiving it, I instantly
made preparations for quitting Vienna, but owing to two or
three things which delayed me, I did not get away till the
20th; I hope that you received the last letter which I sent, as
I doubt not that you are all anxious to hear from me. You
cannot think how anxious I am to get back to you, but since I
am already come so far, it will not do to return before my
object is accomplished. Heaven knows that I do not travel for
travelling's sake, having a widely different object in view. I
came from Vienna here down the Danube, but I daresay I shall
not go farther by the river, but shall travel through the
country to Bucharest in Wallachia, which is the next place I
intend to visit; but Hungary is a widely different country to
Austria, not at all civilised, no coaches, etc., but only carts
and wagons; however, it is all the same thing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> me as I am
quite used to rough it; Bucharest is about three hundred miles
from here; the country, as I have said before, is wild, but the
people are quite harmless&mdash;it is only in Spain that any danger
is to be feared from your fellow creatures. In Bucharest I
shall probably stay a fortnight. I have a letter to a French
gentleman there from Baron Taylor. Pesth is very much like
Edinburgh&mdash;there is an old and a new town, and it is only the
latter which is called Pesth, the name of the old is Buda,
which stands on the side of an enormous mountain overlooking
the new town, the Danube running between. The two towns
together contain about 120,000 inhabitants; I delivered the
letter which dear Woodfall was kind enough to send; it was to a
person, a Scotchman, who is superintending in the building of
the chain bridge over the Danube; he is a very nice person, and
has shown me every kind of civility; indeed, every person here
is very civil; yesterday I dined at the house of a rich Greek;
the dinner was magnificent, the only drawback was that they
pressed me too much to eat and drink; there was a deal of
champagne, and they would make me drink it till I was almost
sick, for it is a wine that I do not like, being far too sweet.
Since I have been here I have bathed twice in the Danube, and
find myself much the better for it; I both sleep and eat better
than I did. I have also been about another chapter, and get on
tolerably well; were I not so particular I should get on
faster, but I wish that everything that I write in this next be
first-rate. Tell Mama that this chapter begins with a dialogue
between her and my father; I have likewise contrived to bring
in the poor old dog in a manner which I think will be
interesting. I began this letter some days ago, but have been
so pleasantly occupied that I have made little progress till
now. Clarke, poor fellow, does not know how to make enough of
me. He says he could scarcely believe his eyes when he first
received the letter, as he has just got <i>The Bible in Spain</i>
from England, and was reading it. This is the 17th, and in a
few days I start for a place called Debreczen, from whence I
shall proceed gradually on my journey. The next letter which
you receive will probably be from Transylvania, the one after
that from Bucharest, and the third D.V. from Constantinople. If
you like you may write to Constantinople, directing it to the
care of the English Ambassador, but be sure to pay the
postage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I left Vienna Baron Hammer, the great Orientalist,
called upon me; his wife was just dead, poor thing, which
prevented him showing me all the civility which he would
otherwise have done. He took me to the Imperial Library. Both
my books were there, <i>Gypsies</i> and <i>Bible</i>. He likewise
procured me a ticket to see the Imperial treasure. (Tell
Henrietta that I saw there the diamond of Charles the Bold; it
is as large as a walnut.) I likewise saw the finest opal, as I
suppose, in the world; it was the size of a middling pear;
there was likewise a hyacinth as big as a swan's egg; I
likewise saw a pearl so large that they had wrought the figure
of a cock out of it, and the cock was somewhat more than an
inch high, but the thing which struck me most was the sword of
Tamerlane, generally called Timour the Tartar; both the hilt
and scabbard were richly adorned with diamonds and emeralds,
but I thought more of the man than I did of them, for he was
the greatest conqueror the world ever saw (I have spoken of him
in <i>Lavengro</i> in the chapter about David Haggart).
Nevertheless, although I have seen all these fine things, I
shall be glad to get back to my Carreta and my darling mother
and to dear Hen. From Debreczen I hope to write to kind dear
Woodfall, and to Lord from Constantinople. I must likewise
write to Hasfeld. The mulet of thirty pounds upon Russian
passports is only intended for the subjects of Russia. I see by
the journals that the Emperor has been in England; I wonder
what he is come about; however, the less I say about that the
better, as I shall soon be in his country. Tell Hen that I have
got her a large piece of Austrian gold money, worth about
forty-two shillings; it is quite new and very handsome;
considerably wider than the Spanish ounce, only not near so
thick, as might be expected, being of considerable less value;
when I get to Constantinople I will endeavour to get a Turkish
gold coin. I have also got a new Austrian silver dollar and a
half one; these are rather cumbersome, and I don't care much
about them&mdash;as for the large gold coin, I carry it in my
pocket-book, which has been of great use to me hitherto. I have
not yet lost anything, only a pocket handkerchief or two as
usual; but I was obliged to buy two other shirts at Vienna; the
weather is so hot, that it is quite necessary to change them
every other day; they were beautiful linen ones, and I think
you will like them when you see. I shall be so glad to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> get
home and continue, if possible, my old occupation. I hope my
next book will sell; one comfort is that nothing like it has
ever been published before. I hope you all get on comfortably,
and that you catch some fish. I hope my dear mother is well,
and that she will continue with you till the end of July at
least; ah! that is my month, I was born in it, it is the
pleasantest month in the year; would to God that my fate had
worn as pleasant an aspect as the month in which I was born.
God bless you all. Write to me, <i>to the care of the British
Embassy</i>, Constantinople. Kind remembrances to Pilgrim.</p></div>

<p>In the intervening journey between Pesth and Constantinople he must have
talked long and wandered far and wide among the gypsies, for Charles L.
Brace in his <i>Hungary in 1851</i> gives us a glimpse of him at Grosswardein
holding conversation with the gypsies:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They described his appearance&mdash;his tall, lank, muscular
form&mdash;and mentioned that he had been much in Spain, and I saw
that it must be that most ubiquitous of travellers, Mr. Borrow.</p></div>

<p>The four following letters require no comment:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, Oulton, Lowestoft</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Debreczen, Hungary</span>, <i>8th July 1844.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My darling Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write to you from Debreczen, a town in
the heart of Hungary, where I have been for the last fortnight
with the exception of three days during which I was making a
journey to Tokay, which is about forty miles distant. My reason
for staying here so long was my liking the place where I have
experienced every kind of hospitality; almost all the people in
these parts are Protestants, and they are so fond of the very
name of Englishmen that when one arrives they scarcely know how
to make enough of him; it is well the place is so remote that
very few are ever seen here, perhaps not oftener than once in
ten years, for if some of our scamps and swell mob were once to
find their way there the good people of Hungary would soon
cease to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> much respect for the English in general; as it
is they think that they are all men of honour and accomplished
gentlemen whom it becomes them to receive well in order that
they may receive from them lessons in civilisation; I wonder
what they would think if they were to meet such fellows as
Squarem and others whom I could mention. I find my knowledge of
languages here of great use, and the people are astonished to
hear me speak French, Italian, German, Russian, and
occasionally Gypsy. I have already met with several Gypsies;
those who live abroad in the wildernesses are quite black; the
more civilised wander about as musicians, playing on the
fiddle, at which they are very expert, they speak the same
languages as those in England, with slight variations, and upon
the whole they understand me very well. Amongst other places I
have been to Tokay, where I drank some of the wine. I am
endeavouring to bring two or three bottles to England, for I
thought of my mother and yourself and Hen., and I have got a
little wooden case made; it is very sweet and of a pale straw
colour; whether I shall be able to manage it I do not know;
however, I shall make the attempt. At Tokay the wine is only
two shillings the bottle, and I have a great desire that you
should taste some of it. I sincerely hope that we shall soon
all meet together in health and peace. I shall be glad enough
to get home, but since I am come so far it is as well to see as
much as possible. Would you think it, the Bishop of Debreczen
came to see me the other day and escorted me about the town,
followed by all the professors of the college; this was done
merely because I was an Englishman and a Protestant, for here
they are almost all of the reformed religion and full of love
and enthusiasm for it. It is probable that you will hear from
Woodfall in a day or two; the day before yesterday I wrote to
him and begged him to write to you to let you know, as I am
fearful of a letter miscarrying and your being uneasy. This is
unfortunately post day and I must send away the letter in a
very little time, so that I cannot say all to you that I could
wish; I shall stay here about a week longer, and from here
shall make the best of my way to Transylvania and Bucharest; I
shall stay at Bucharest about a fortnight, and shall then dash
off for Constantinople&mdash;I shan't stay there long&mdash;but when once
there it matters not as it is a civilised country from which
start steamers to any part where you may want to go. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> hope to
receive a letter from you there. You cannot imagine what
pleasure I felt when I got your last. Oh, it was such a comfort
to me! I shall have much to tell you when I get back. Yesterday
I went to see a poor wretch who is about to be hanged; he
committed a murder here two years ago, and the day after
to-morrow he is to be executed&mdash;they expose the people here who
are to suffer three days previous to their execution&mdash;I found
him in a small apartment guarded by soldiers, with hundreds of
people staring at him through the door and the windows; I was
admitted into the room as I went with two officers; he had an
enormous chain about his waist and his feet were manacled; he
sat smoking a pipe; he was, however, very penitent, and said
that he deserved to die, as well he might; he had murdered four
people, beating out their brains with a club; he was without
work, and requested of an honest man here to receive him into
his house one night until the morning. In the middle of the
night he got up, and with his brother, who was with him, killed
every person in the house and then plundered it; two days
after, he was taken; his brother died in prison; I gave him a
little money, and the gentleman who was with me gave him some
good advice; he looked most like a wild beast, a huge mantle of
skin covered his body; for nine months he had not seen the
daylight; but now he is brought out into a nice clean
apartment, and allowed to have everything he asks for, meat,
wine, tobacco&mdash;nothing is refused him during these last three
days. I cannot help thinking that it is a great cruelty to keep
people so long in so horrid a situation; it is two years nearly
since he has been condemned. Do not be anxious if you do not
hear from me regularly for some time. There is no escort post
in the countries to which I am going. God bless my mother,
yourself, and Hen.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Hermanstadt</span>, <i>July 30, 1844.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write to you a line or two from this
place; it is close upon the frontier of Wallachia. I hope to be
in Bucharest in a few days&mdash;I have stopped here for a day owing
to some difficulty in getting horses&mdash;I shall hasten onward as
quick as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> possible. In Bucharest there is an English Consul, so
that I shall feel more at home than I do here. I am only a few
miles now from the termination of the Austrian dominions, their
extent is enormous, the whole length of Hungary and
Transylvania; I shall only stay a few days in Bucharest and
shall then dash off straight for Constantinople; I have no time
to lose as there is a high ridge of mountains to cross called
the Balkans, where the winter commences at the beginning of
September. I thought you would be glad to hear from me, on
which account I write. I sent off a letter about a week ago
from Klausenburg, which I hope you will receive. I have written
various times from Hungary, though whether the letters have
reached you is more than I can say. I wrote to Woodfall from
Debreczen. I have often told you how glad I shall be to get
home and see you again. If I have tarried, it has only been
because I wished to see and learn as much as I could, for it
was no use coming to such a distance for nothing. By the time I
return I shall have made a most enormous journey, such as very
few have made. The place from which I write is very romantic,
being situated at the foot of a ridge of enormous mountains
which extend to the clouds, they look higher than the Pyrenees.
My health, thank God, is very good. I bathed to-day and feel
all the better for it; I hope you are getting on well, and that
all our dear family is comfortable. I hope my dear mother is
well. Oh, it is so pleasant to hope that I am still not alone
in the world, and that there are those who love and care for me
and pray for me. I shall be very glad to get to Constantinople,
as from there there is no difficulty; and a great part of the
way to Russia is by sea, and when I am in Russia I am almost at
home. I shall write to you again from Bucharest if it please
God. It is not much more than eighty miles from here, but the
way lies over the mountains, so that the journey will take
three or four days. We travel here in tilted carts drawn by
ponies; the carts are without springs, so that one is terribly
shaken. It is, however, very healthy, especially when one has a
strong constitution. The carts are chiefly made of sticks and
wickerwork; they are, of course, very slight, and indeed if
they were not so they would soon go to pieces owing to the
jolting. I read your little book every morning; it is true that
I am sometimes wrong with respect to the date, but I soon get
right again; oh, I shall be so glad to see you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> and my mother
and old Hen. and Lucy and the whole dear circle. I hope Crups
is well, and the horse. Oh, I shall be so glad to come back.
God bless you, my heart's darling, and dear Hen.; kiss her for
me, and my mother.</p></div>

the Consul, Mr. Colquhoun, to inform you that I arrived at
Bucharest quite safe: the post leaves to-day, and Mr. C. has
kindly permitted me to send a note along with the official
despatches. I am quite well, thank God, but I thought you would
like to hear from me. Bucharest is in the province of Wallachia
and close upon the Turkish frontier. I shall remain here a week
or two as I find the place a very interesting one; then I shall
proceed to Constantinople. I wrote to you from Hermanstadt last
week and the week previous from Clausenburgh, and before I
leave I shall write again, and not so briefly as now. I have
experienced every possible attention from Mr. C., who is a very
delightful person, and indeed everybody is very kind and
attentive. I hope sincerely that you and Hen. are quite well

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My darling Carreta</span>,&mdash;To-morrow or the next day I leave
Bucharest for Constantinople. I wrote to you on my arrival a
few days ago, and promise to write again before my departure. I
shall not be sorry to get to Constantinople, as from thence I
can go where-ever I think proper without any difficulty. Since
I have been here, Mr. Colquhoun, the British Consul-General,
has shown me every civility, and upon the whole I have not
passed the time disagreeably. I have been chiefly occupied of
late in rubbing up my Turkish a little, which I had almost
forgotten; there was a time when I wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> it better than any
other language. It is coming again rapidly, and I make no doubt
that in a little time I should speak it almost as well as
Spanish, for I understand the groundwork. In Hungary and
Germany I picked up some curious books, which will help to pass
the time at home when I have nothing better to do. It is a long
way from here to Constantinople, and it is probable that I
shall be fifteen or sixteen days on the journey, as I do not
intend to travel very fast. It is possible that I shall stay a
day or two at Adrianople, which is half way. If you should not
hear from me for some time don't be alarmed, as it is possible
that I shall have no opportunities of writing till I get to
Constantinople. Bucharest, where I am now, is close on the
Turkish frontier, being only half a day's journey. Since I have
been here, I have bought a Tartar dress and a couple of Turkish
shirts. I have done so in order not to be stared at as I pass
along. It is very beautiful and by no means dear. Yesterday I
wrote to M. Since I have been here I have seen some English
newspapers, and see that chap H. has got in with M. Perhaps his
recommendation was that he had once insulted us. However, God
only knows. I think I had never much confidence in M. I can
read countenances as you know, and have always believed him to
be selfish and insincere. I, however, care nothing about him,
and will not allow, D.V., any conduct of his to disturb me. I
shall be glad to get home, and if I can but settle down a
little, I feel that I can accomplish something great. I hope
that my dear mother is well, and that you are all well. God
bless you. It is something to think that since I have been away
I have to a certain extent accomplished what I went about. I am
stronger and better and hardier, my cough has left me, there is
only occasionally a little huskiness in the throat. I have also
increased my stock of languages, and my imagination is
brightened, Bucharest is a strange place with much grandeur and
much filth. Since I have been here I have dined almost every
day with Mr. C., who wants me to have an apartment in his
house. I thought it, however, better to be at an inn, though
filthy. I have also dined once at the Russian Consul-General's,
whom I knew in Russia. Now God bless you my heart's darling;
kiss also Hen., write to my mother, and remember me to all
friends.</p></div>

<p>The best letter that I have of this journey, and indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> the best letter
of Borrow's that I have read, is one from Constantinople to his
wife&mdash;the only letter by him from that city:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, Oulton, Lowestoft</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Constantinople</span>, 16<i>th September 1844.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My darling Carreta</span>,&mdash;I am about to leave Constantinople and to
return home. I have given up the idea of going to Russia; I
find that if I go to Odessa I shall have to remain in
quarantine for fourteen days, which I have no inclination to
do; I am, moreover, anxious to get home, being quite tired of
wandering, and desirous of being once more with my loved ones.
This is a most interesting place, but unfortunately it is
extremely dear. The Turks have no inns, and I am here at an
English one, at which, though everything is comfortable, the
prices are very high. To-day is Monday, and next Friday I
purpose starting for Salonica in a steamboat&mdash;Salonica is in
Albania. I shall then cross Albania, a journey of about three
hundred miles, and get to Corfu, from which I can either get to
England across Italy and down the Rhine, or by way of
Marseilles and across France. I shall not make any stay in
Italy if I go there, as I have nothing to see there. I shall be
so glad to be at home with you once again, and to see my dear
mother and Hen. Tell Hen. that I picked up for her in one of
the bazaars a curious Armenian coin; it is silver, small, but
thick, with a most curious inscription upon it. I gave fifteen
piastres for it. I hope it and the rest will get safe to
England. I have bought a chest, which I intend to send by sea,
and I have picked up a great many books and other things, and I
wish to travel light; I shall, therefore, only take a bag with
a few clothes and shirts. It is possible that I shall be at
home soon after your receiving this, or at most three weeks
after. I hope to write to you again from Corfu, which is a
British island with a British garrison in it, like Gibraltar;
the English newspapers came last week. I see those wretched
French cannot let us alone, they want to go to war; well, let
them; they richly deserve a good drubbing. The people here are
very kind in their way, but home is home, especially such a one
as mine, with true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> hearts to welcome me. Oh, I was so glad to
get your letters; they were rather of a distant date, it is
true, but they quite revived me. I hope you are all well, and
my dear mother. Since I have been here I have written to Mr.
Lord. I was glad to hear that he has written to Hen. I hope
Lucy is well; pray remember me most kindly to her, and tell her
that I hope to see her soon. I count so of getting into my
summer-house again, and sitting down to write; I have arranged
my book in my mind, and though it will take me a great deal of
trouble to write it, I feel that when it is written it will be
first-rate. My journey, with God's help, has done me a great
deal of good. I am stronger than I was, and I can now sleep. I
intend to draw on England for forty or fifty pounds; if I don't
want the whole of it, it will be all the same. I have still
some money left, but I have no wish to be stopped on my journey
for want of it. I am sorry about what you told me respecting
the railway, sorry that the old coach is driven off the road. I
shall patronise it as little as possible, but stick to the old
route and Thurton George. What a number of poor people will
these railroads deprive of their bread. I am grieved at what
you say about poor M.; he can take her into custody, however,
and oblige her to support the children; such is law, though the
property may have been secured to her, she can be compelled to
do that. Tell Hen. that there is a mosque here, called the
mosque of Sultan Bajazet; it is full of sacred pigeons; there
is a corner of the court to which the creatures flock to be
fed, like bees, by hundreds and thousands; they are not at all
afraid, as they are never killed. Every place where they can
roost is covered with them, their impudence is great; they
sprang originally from two pigeons brought from Asia by the
Emperor of Constantinople. They are of a deep blue. God bless
you, dearest.</p></div>

<p>He returned home by way of Venice and Rome as the following two letters
indicate:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, Oulton, Lowestoft</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>22nd Octr. 1844.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;I arrived this day at Venice, and though
I am exceedingly tired I hasten to write a line to inform you
of my well-being. I am now making for home as fast as possible,
and I have now nothing to detain me. Since I wrote to you last
I have been again in quarantine for two days and a half at
Trieste, but I am glad to say that I shall no longer be
detained on that account. I was obliged to go to Trieste,
though it was much out of my way, otherwise I must have
remained I know not how long in Corfu, waiting for a direct
conveyance. After my liberation I only stopped a day at Corfu
in order that I might lose no more time, though I really wished
to tarry there a little longer, the people were so kind. On the
day of my liberation, I had four invitations to dinner from the
officers. I, however, made the most of my time, and escorted by
one Captain Northcott, of the Rifles, went over the
fortifications, which are most magnificent. I saw everything
that I well could, and shall never forget the kindness with
which I was treated. The next day I went to Trieste in a
steamer, down the whole length of the Adriatic. I was horribly
unwell, for the Adriatic is a bad sea, and very dangerous; the
weather was also very rough; after stopping at Trieste a day,
besides the quarantine, I left for Venice, and here I am, and
hope to be on my route again the day after to-morrow. I shall
now hurry through Italy by way of Ancona, Rome, and Civita
Vecchia to Marseilles in France and from Marseilles to London,
in not more than six days' journey. Oh, I shall be so glad to
get back to you and my mother (I hope she is alive and well)
and Hen. I am glad to hear that we are not to have a war with
those silly people, the French. The idea made me very uneasy,
for I thought how near Oulton lay to the coast. You cannot
imagine what a magnificent old town Venice is; it is clearly
the finest in Italy, although in decay; it stands upon islands
in the sea, and in many places is intersected with canals. The
Grand Canal is four miles long, lined with palaces on either
side. I, however, shall be glad to leave it, for there is no
place to me like Oulton, where live two of my dear ones. I have
told you that I am very tired, so that I cannot write much
more, and I am presently going to bed, but I am sure that you
will be glad to hear from me, however little I may write. I
think I told you in my last letter that I had been to the top
of Mount Olympus in Thessaly. Tell Hen. that I saw a whole herd
of wild deer bounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> down the cliffs, the noise they made was
like thunder; I also saw an enormous eagle&mdash;one of Jupiter's
birds, his real eagles, for, according to the Grecian
mythology, Olympus was his favourite haunt. I don't know what
it was then, but at present the most wild savage place I ever
saw; an immense way up I came to a forest of pines; half of
them were broken by thunderbolts, snapped in the middle, and
the ruins lying around in the most hideous confusion; some had
been blasted from top to bottom and stood naked, black, and
charred, in indescribable horridness; Jupiter was the god of
thunder, and he still seems to haunt Olympus. The worst is
there is little water, so that a person might almost perish
there of thirst; the snow-water, however, when it runs into the
hollows is the most delicious beverage ever tasted&mdash;the snow,
however, is very high up. My next letter, I hope, will be from
Marseilles, and I hope to be there in a very few days. Now, God
bless you, my dearest; write to my mother, and kiss Hen., and
remember me kindly to Lucy and the Atkinses.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Rome</span>, <i>1 Nov. 1844.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dearest Carreta</span>,&mdash;My last letter was from Ancona; the
present is, as you see, from Rome. From Ancona I likewise wrote
to Woodfall requesting he would send a letter of credit for
twelve or fifteen pounds, directing to the care of the British
Consul at Marseilles. I hope you received your letter and that
he received his, as by the time I get to Marseilles I shall be
in want of money by reason of the roundabout way I have been
obliged to come. I am quite well, thank God, and hope to leave
here in a day or two. It is close by the sea, and France is
close by, but I am afraid I shall be obliged to wait some days
at Marseilles before I shall get the letter, as the post goes
direct from no part of Italy, though it is not more than six
days' journey, or seven at most, from Ancona to London. It was
that wretched quarantine at Corfu that has been the cause of
all this delay, as it caused me to lose the passage by the
steamer [original torn here] Ancona, which forced me to go
round by Trieste and Venice, five hundred miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> out of my way,
at a considerable expense. Oh, I shall be so glad to get home.
As I told you before, I am quite well; indeed, in better health
than I have been for years, but it is very vexatious to be
stopped in the manner I have been. God bless you, my darling.
Write to my mother and kiss her.</p></div>

<h3><i>LAVENGRO</i></h3>


<p><i>The Bible in Spain</i> bears on its title-page the date 1843, although my
copy makes it clear in Borrow's handwriting that it was really ready for
publication in the previous year.</p>

<p>Borrow's handwriting had changed its character somewhat when he
inscribed to his wife a copy of his next book <i>Lavengro</i> in 1851.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-0312-2.jpg" width="350" height="190" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In the intervening eight or nine years he had travelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> much&mdash;suffered
much. During all these years he had been thinking about, talking about,
his next book, making no secret of the fact that it was to be an
Autobiography. Even before <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was issued he had
written to Mr. John Murray foreshadowing a book in which his father,
William Taylor, and others were to put in an appearance. In the
'Advertisement' to <i>The Romany Rye</i> he tells us that 'the principal part
of <i>Lavengro</i> was written in the year '43, that the whole of it was
completed before the termination of the year '46, and that it was in the
hands of the publisher in the year '48.' As the idea grew in his mind,
his friend, Richard Ford, gave him much sound advice:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Never mind nimminy-pimminy people thinking subjects <i>low</i>.
Things are low in manner of handling. Draw Nature in rags and
poverty, yet draw her truly, and how picturesque! I hate your
silver fork, kid glove, curly-haired school.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p></div>

<p>And so in the following years, now to Ford, now to Murray, he traces his
progress, while in 1844 he tells Dawson Turner that he is 'at present
engaged in a kind of Biography in the Robinson Crusoe style.'<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> But
in the same year he went to Buda-Pesth, Venice, and Constantinople. The
first advertisement of the book appeared in <i>The Quarterly Review</i> in
July 1848, when <i>Lavengro, An Autobiography</i>, was announced. Later in
the same year Mr. Murray advertised the book as <i>Life, A Drama</i>; and Dr.
Knapp, who had in his collection the original proof-sheets of
<i>Lavengro</i>, reproduces the title-page of the book which then stood as
<i>Life, A Drama</i>, and bore the date 1849. Borrow's procrastination in
delivering the complete book worried John Murray exceedingly. Not
unnaturally, for in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> 1848 he had offered the book at his annual sale
dinner to the booksellers who had subscribed to it liberally. Eighteen
months later Murray was still worrying Borrow for the return of the
proof-sheets of the third and last volume. Not until January 1850 do we
hear of it as <i>Lavengro, An Autobiography</i>, and under this title it was
advertised in <i>The Quarterly Review</i> for that month as 'nearly ready for
publication.' In April 1850 we find Woodfall, John Murray's printer,
writing letter after letter urging celerity, to which Mrs. Borrow
replies, excusing the delay on account of her husband's indifferent
health. They have been together in lodgings at Yarmouth. 'He had many
plunges into the briny Ocean, which seemed to do him good.'<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Murray
continued to exhort, but the final chapter did not reach him. 'My sale
is fixed for December 12th,' he writes in November, 'and if I cannot
show the book then I must throw it up.' This threat had little effect,
for on 13th December we find Murray still coaxing his dilatory author,
telling him with justice that there were passages in his book 'equal to
Defoe.' The very printer, Mr. Woodfall, joined in the chase. 'The public
is quite prepared to devour your book,' he wrote, which was unhappily
not the case. Nor was Ford a happier prophet, although a true friend
when he wrote&mdash;'I am sure it will be <i>the</i> book of the year when it is
brought forth.'<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The activity of Mrs. Borrow in this matter of the
publication of <i>Lavengro</i> is interesting. 'My husband ... is, I assure
you, doing all he can as regards the completion of the book,' she
writes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> to Mr. Murray in December 1849, and in November of the following
year Murray writes to her to say that he is engraving Phillips's
portrait of Borrow for the book. 'I think a cheering letter from you
will do Mr. Borrow good,' she writes later. Throughout the whole
correspondence between publisher and printer we are impressed by Mrs.
Borrow's keen interest in her husband's book, her anxiety that he should
be humoured. Sadly did Borrow need to be humoured, for if he had
cherished the illusion that his book would really be the 'Book of the
Year' he was to suffer a cruel disillusion. Scarcely any one wanted it.
All the critics abused it. In <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> it was bluntly pronounced a
failure. 'The story of <i>Lavengro</i> will content no one,' said Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>. The book 'will add but little
to Mr. Borrow's reputation,' said <i>Blackwood</i>. The only real insight
into the book's significance was provided by Thomas Gordon Hake in a
letter to <i>The New Monthly Review</i>, in which journal the editor,
Harrison Ainsworth, had already pronounced a not very favourable
opinion. '<i>Lavengro's</i> roots will strike deep into the soil of English
letters,' wrote Dr. Hake, and he then pronounced a verdict now
universally accepted. George Henry Lewes once happily remarked that he
would make an appreciation of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i> a test of
friendship. Many of us would be almost equally inclined to make such a
test of Borrow's <i>Lavengro</i>. Tennyson declared that an enthusiasm for
Milton's <i>Lycidas</i> was a touchstone of taste in poetry. May we not say
that an enthusiasm for Borrow's <i>Lavengro</i> is now a touchstone of taste
in English prose literature?</p>

<p>But the reception of <i>Lavengro</i> by the critics, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> also by the
public,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> may be said to have destroyed Borrow's moral fibre.
Henceforth, it was a soured and disappointed man who went forth to meet
the world. We hear much in the gossip of contemporaries of Borrow's
eccentricities, it may be of his rudeness and gruffness, in the last
years of his life. Only those who can realise the personality of a
self-contained man, conscious, as all genius has ever been, of its
achievement, and conscious also of the failure of the world to
recognise, will understand&mdash;and will sympathise.</p>

<p>Borrow, as we have seen, took many years to write <i>Lavengro</i>. 'I am
writing the work,' he told Dawson Turner, 'in precisely the same manner
as <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, viz., on blank sheets of old account-books,
backs of letters,' etc., and he recalls Mahomet writing the Koran on
mutton bones as an analogy to his own 'slovenliness of manuscript.'<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
I have had plenty of opportunity of testing this slovenliness in the
collection of manuscripts of portions of <i>Lavengro</i> that have come into
my possession. These are written upon pieces of paper of all shapes and
sizes, although at least a third of the book in Borrow's very neat
handwriting is contained in a leather notebook, of which I give examples
of the title-page and opening leaf in facsimile. The title-page
demonstrates the earliest form of Borrow's conception. Not only did he
then contemplate an undisguised autobiography, but even described
himself, as he frequently did in his conversation, as 'a Norfolk man.'
Before the book was finished, however, he repudiated the
autobiographical note, and by the time he sat down to write <i>The Romany
Rye</i> we find him fiercely denouncing his critics for coming to such a
conclusion. 'The writer,' he declares, 'never said it was an
autobiography; never authorised any person to say it was one.' Which was
doubtless true, in a measure. Yet I find among my Borrow Papers the
following letter from Whitwell Elwin, who, writing from Booton Rectory
on 21st October 1852, and addressing him as 'My dear Mr. Borrow,' said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hoped to have been able to call upon you at Yarmouth, but a
heavy cold first, and now occupation, have interfered with my
intentions. I daresay you have seen the mention made of your
<i>Lavengro</i> in the article on Haydon in the current number of
<i>The Quarterly Review</i>, and I thought you might like to know
that every syllable, both comment and extract, was inserted by
the writer (a man little given to praise) of his own <i>accord</i>.
Murray sent him your book, and that was all. No addition or
modification was made by myself, and it is therefore the
unbiassed judgment of a <i>very critical</i> reviewer. Whenever you
appear again before the public I shall endeavour to do ample
justice to your past and present merits, and there is one point
in which you could aid those who understand you and your books
in bringing over general readers to your side. I was myself
acquainted with many of the persons you have sketched in your
<i>Lavengro</i>, and I can testify to the extraordinary vividness
and accuracy of the portraits. What I have seen, again, of
yourself tells me that romantic adventures are your natural
element, and I should <i>a priori</i> expect that much of your
history would be stranger than fiction. But you must remember
that the bulk of readers have no personal acquaintance with
you, or the characters you describe. The consequence is that
they fancy there is an immensity of romance mixed up with the
facts, and they are irritated by the inability to distinguish
between them. I am confident, from all I have heard, that this
was the source of the comparatively cold reception of
<i>Lavengro</i>. I should have partaken the feeling myself if I had
not had the means of testing the fidelity of many portions of
the book, from which I inferred the equal fidelity of the rest.
I think you have the remedy in your own hands, viz., by giving
the utmost possible matter-of-fact air to your sequel. I do not
mean that you are to tame down the truth, but some ways of
narrating a story make it seem more credible than others, and
if you were so far to defer to the ignorance of the public they
would enter into the full spirit of your rich and racy
narrative. You naturally look at your life from your own point
of view, and this in itself is the best; but when you publish a
book you invite the reader to participate in the events of your
career, and it is necessary then to look a little at things
from <i>his</i> point of view. As he has not your knowledge you must
stoop to him. I throw this out for your consideration. My sole
wish is that the public should have a right estimate of you,
and surely you ought to do what is in your power to help them
to it. I know you will excuse the liberty I take in offering
this crude suggestion. Take it for what it is worth, but
anyhow....</p></div>

<p>To this letter, as we learn from Elwin's <i>Life</i>, 'instead of roaring
like a lion,' as Elwin had expected, he returned quite a 'lamb-like
note.'</p>

<p>Read by the light in which we all judge the book to-day, this estimate
by Elwin was about as fatuous as most contemporary criticisms of a
masterpiece. Which is only to say that it is rarely given to
contemporary critics to judge accurately of the great work that comes to
them amid a mass that is not great. That Elwin, although not a good
editor of Pope, was a sound critic of the literature of a period
anterior to his own is demonstrated by the admirable essays from his pen
that have been reprinted with an excellent memoir of him by his
son.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In this memoir we have a capital glimpse of our hero:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Among the notables whom he had met was Borrow, whose <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>Romany Rye</i> he afterwards reviewed in 1857 under the title
of 'Roving Life in England,' Their interview was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
characteristic of both. Borrow was just then very sore with his
snarling critics, and on some one mentioning that Elwin was a
<i>quartering</i> reviewer, he said, 'Sir, I wish you a better
employment.' Then hastily changing the subject he called out,
'What party are <i>you</i> in the Church&mdash;Tractarian, Moderate, or
Evangelical? I am happy to say I am the old <i>High</i>.' 'I am
happy to say I am <i>not</i>,' was Elwin's emphatic reply. Borrow
boasted of his proficiency in the Norfolk dialect, which he
endeavoured to speak as broadly as possible. 'I told him,' said
Elwin, 'that he had not cultivated it with his usual success.'
As the conversation proceeded it became less disputatious, and
the two ended by becoming so cordial that they promised to
visit each other. Borrow fulfilled his promise in the following
October, when he went to Booton,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and was 'full of anecdote
and reminiscence,' and delighted the rectory children by
singing them songs in the gypsy tongue. Elwin during this visit
urged him to try his hand at an article for the <i>Review</i>.
'Never,' he said; 'I have made a resolution never to have
anything to do with such a blackguard trade.'</p></div>

<p>While writing of Whitwell Elwin and his association with Borrow, which
was sometimes rather strained as we shall see when <i>The Romany Rye</i>
comes to be published, it is interesting to turn to Elwin's final
impression of Borrow, as conveyed in a letter which the recipient<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
has kindly placed at my disposal. It was written from Booton Rectory,
and is dated 27th October 1893:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>I used occasionally to meet Borrow at the house of Mr. Murray,
his publisher, and he once stayed with me here for two or three
days about 1855. He always seemed to me quite at ease 'among
refined people,' and I should not have ascribed his dogmatic
tone, when he adopted it, to his resentment at finding himself
out of keeping with his society. A spirit of self-assertion was
engrained in him, and it was supported by a combative
temperament. As he was proud of his bodily prowess, and rather
given to parade it, so he took the same view of an argument as
of a battle with fists, and thought that manliness required him
to be determined and unflinching. But this, in my experience of
him, was not his ordinary manner, which was calm and
companionable, without rudeness of any kind, unless some
difference occurred to provoke his pugnacity. I have witnessed
instances of his care to avoid wounding feelings needlessly. He
never kept back his opinions which, on some points, were
shallow and even absurd; and when his antagonist was as
persistently positive as himself, he was apt to be over
vehement in contradiction. I have heard Mr. Murray say that
once in a dispute with Dr. Whewell at a dinner the language on
both sides grew so fiery that Mrs. Whewell fainted.</p>

<p>He told me that his composition cost him a vast amount of
labour, that his first draughts were diffuse and crude, and
that he wrote his productions several times before he had
condensed and polished them to his mind. There is nothing
choicer in the English language than some of his narratives,
descriptions, and sketches of character, but in his best books
he did not always prune sufficiently, and in his last work,
<i>Wild Wales</i>, he seemed to me to have lost the faculty
altogether. Mr. Murray long refused to publish it unless it was
curtailed, and Borrow, with his usual self-will and
self-confidence, refused to retrench the trivialities. Either
he got his own way in the end, or he revised his manuscript to
little purpose.</p>

<p>Probably most of what there was to tell of Borrow has been
related by himself. It is a disadvantage in <i>Lavengro</i> and
<i>Romany Rye</i> that we cannot with certainty separate fact from
fiction, for he avowed in talk that, like Goethe, he had
assumed the right in the interests of his autobiographical
narrative to embellish it in places; but the main outline, and
larger part of the details, are the genuine record of what he
had seen and done, and I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> testify that some of his minor
personages who were known to me in my boyhood are described
with perfect accuracy.</p></div>

<p>Two letters by Mr. Elwin to Borrow, from my Borrow Papers, both dated
1853&mdash;two years after <i>Lavengro</i> was written,&mdash;may well have place here:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Booton, Norwich</span>, <i>Oct. 26, 1853.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Borrow</span>,&mdash;I shall be rejoiced to see you here, and I
hope you will fasten a little luggage to the bow of your
saddle, and spend as much time under my roof as you can spare.
I am always at home. Mrs. Elwin is sure to be in the house or
garden, and I, at the worst, not further off than the extreme
boundary of my parish. Pray come, and that quickly. Your
shortest road from Norwich is through Horsford, and from thence
to the park wall of Haverland Hall, which you skirt. This will
bring you out by a small wayside public house, well known in
these parts, called 'The Rat-catchers.' At this point you turn
sharp to the left, and keep the straight road till you come to
a church with a new red brick house adjoining, which is your
journey's end.</p>

<p>The conclusion of your note to me is so true in sentiment, and
so admirable in expression, that I hope you will introduce it
into your next work. I wish it had been said in the article on
Haydon. Cannot you strew such criticisms through the sequel to
<i>Lavengro</i>? They would give additional charm and value to the
work. Believe me, very truly yours,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">W. Elwin.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are of course aware that if <i>I</i> had spoken of <i>Lavengro</i> in
the <i>Q.R.</i> I should have said much more, but as I hoped for my
turn hereafter, I preferred to let the passage go forth
unadulterated.</p></div>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Booton Rectory, Norwich</span>, <i>Nov. 5, 1853.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Borrow</span>,&mdash;-You bore your mishap with a philosophic
patience, and started with an energy which gives the best
earnest that you would arrive safe and sound at Norwich. I was
happy to find yesterday morning, by the arrival of your kind
present, a sure notification that you were well home. Many
thanks for the tea, which we drink with great zest and
diligence. My legs are not as long as yours, nor my breath
either. You soon made me feel that I must either turn back or
be left behind, so I chose the former. Mrs. Elwin and my
children desire their kind regards. They one and all enjoyed
your visit. Believe me, very truly yours,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">W. Elwin.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>I have said that I possess large portions of <i>Lavengro</i> in manuscript.
Borrow's always helpful wife, however, copied out the whole manuscript
for the publishers, and this 'clean copy' came to Dr. Knapp, who found
even here a few pages of very valuable writing deleted, and these he has
very rightly restored in Mr. Murray's edition of <i>Lavengro</i>. Why Borrow
took so much pains to explain that his wife had copied <i>Lavengro</i>, as
the following document implies, I cannot think. I find in his
handwriting this scrap of paper signed by Mary Borrow, and witnessed by
her daughter:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Janry. 30, 1869.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is to certify that I transcribed <i>The Bible in Spain</i>,
<i>Lavengro</i>, and some other works of my husband George Borrow,
from the original manuscripts. A considerable portion of the
transcript of <i>Lavengro</i> was lost at the printing-office where
the work was printed.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;"><span class="smcap">Mary Borrow.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Witness: Henrietta M., daughter of Mary Borrow.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It only remains here to state the melancholy fact once again that
<i>Lavengro</i>, great work of literature as it is now universally
acknowledged to be, was not 'the book of the year.' The three thousand
copies of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> the first issue took more than twenty years to sell, and it
was not until 1872 that Mr. Murray resolved to issue a cheaper edition.
The time was not ripe for the cult of the open road; the zest for 'the
wind on the heath' that our age shares so keenly.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO CORNISH KINSMEN</h3>


<p>If Borrow had been a normal man of letters he would have been quite
satisfied to settle down at Oulton, in a comfortable home, with a
devoted wife. The question of money was no longer to worry him. He had
moreover a money-making gift, which made him independent in a measure of
his wife's fortune. From <i>The Bible in Spain</i> he must have drawn a very
considerable amount, considerable, that is, for a man whose habits were
always somewhat penurious. <i>The Bible in Spain</i> would have been followed
up, were Borrow a quite other kind of man, by a succession of books
almost equally remunerative. Even for one so prone to hate both books
and bookmen there was always the wind on the heath, the gypsy
encampment, the now famous 'broad,' not then the haunt of innumerable
trippers. But Borrow ever loved wandering more than writing. Almost
immediately after his marriage&mdash;in 1840&mdash;he hinted to the Bible Society
of a journey to China; a year later, in June 1841, he suggested to Lord
Clarendon that Lord Palmerston might give him a consulship: he consulted
Hasfeld as to a possible livelihood in Berlin, and Ford as to travel in
Africa. He seems to have endured residence at Oulton with difficulty
during the succeeding three years, and in 1844 we find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> him engaged upon
the continental travel that we have already recorded. In 1847 he had
hopes of the consulship at Canton, but Bowring wanted it for himself,
and a misunderstanding over this led to an inevitable break of old
friendship. Borrow's passionate love of travel was never more to be
gratified at the expense of others. He tried hard, indeed, to secure a
journey to the East from the British Museum Trustees, and then gave up
the struggle. Further wanderings, which were many, were to be confined
to Europe and indeed to England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man.
His first journey, however, was not at his own initiative. Mrs. Borrow's
health was unequal to the severe winters at Oulton, and so the Borrows
made their home at Yarmouth from 1853 to 1860. During these years he
gave his vagabond propensities full play. No year passed without its
record of wandering. His first expedition was the outcome of a burst of
notoriety that seems to have done for Borrow what the success of his
<i>Bible in Spain</i> could not do&mdash;revealed his identity to his Cornish
relations. The <i>Bury Post</i> of 17th September 1853 recorded that Borrow
had at the risk of his life saved at least one member of a boat's crew
wrecked on the coast at Yarmouth:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The moment was an awful one, when George Borrow, the well-known
author of <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, dashed into the
surf and saved one life, and through his instrumentality the
others were saved. We ourselves have known this brave and
gifted man for years, and, daring as was his deed, we have
known him more than once to risk his life for others. We are
happy to add that he has sustained no material injury.</p></div>

<p>I was quite sorry to find this extract from the <i>Bury Post</i> among my
Borrow Papers in Mrs. Borrow's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> handwriting. It a little suggests that
she sent the copy to the journal in question, or at least inspired the
paragraph, perhaps in a letter to her friend, Dr. Gordon Hake, who with
his family then resided at Bury St. Edmunds. Borrow was a perfect
swimmer, and there is no reason to suppose but that he did act
heroically.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> In my Borrow Papers I find in his handwriting his own
account of the adventure:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was seated on Yarmouth jetty; the weather was very stormy;
there came a tremendous sea, which struck the jetty, and made
it quiver; there was a boat on the lee-side of the jetty
fastened by a painter; the surge snapped the painter like a
thread, the boat was overset with two men in it, there was a
cry, 'The men must be drowned.' I started up from my seat on
the north side of the jetty, and saw the boat bottom upwards,
and I heard some people say, 'The men are under it.' I ran a
little way along the jetty, and then jumped upon the sand;
before taking the leap I saw a man flung by the surge upon the
shore; he crawled up upon the beach, and was, I believe, lifted
up upon his legs by certain beachmen. I had my eye upon the
boat, which was now near the shore; I had an idea that there
was a man under it; I flung off my coat and hat, and went a
little way into the sea, about parallel to some beachmen who
were moving backwards and forwards as the waves advanced and
receded. I now saw a man as a wave recoiled lying close by the
boat in the reflux. I dashed forward and made a grip at the
man, then came a tremendous wave which tumbled me heels over
head; being an expert diver I did not attempt to rise, lest I
should be flung on shore. When the wave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> receded, I found
myself near the boat; the man was now nearer to the shore than
myself. I believe a man or two were making towards him; another
wave came which overwhelmed me, and flung me on the shore, to
which I was now making with all my strength. I got on my legs
for one moment, when the advanced guard, if I may call it so,
of another wave, struck me on the back, and laid me upon my
face, but I was now quite out of danger. A man now came and
lifted me up, as others lifted up the other man, who seemed
quite unable to exert himself. The above is a plain statement
of facts. I was the only person, with the exception of the man
in distress, who was in the deep water, or who confronted the
billows, which were indeed monstrous, but which I cared little
for, being, as I said before, an expert diver. Had I been alone
the result of the affair would have been much the same; as it
is, after the last wave I could easily have dragged the man up
upon the beach. I am willing to give to the beachmen whatever
credit is due to them; I am anxious to believe that one of them
was once up to his middle in water, but truth compels me to
state that I never saw one of them up to his knees. I received
very uncivil language from one of them, but every species of
respect and sympathy from the genteel part of the spectators. A
gentleman, I believe from Norwich, and a policeman, attended me
in a cab to my lodgings, where they undressed and dressed me.
The kindness of these two individuals I shall never forget.</p></div>

<p>In any case this adventure had exceptional publicity. For example Mr.
Robert Cooke of John Murray's firm wrote to Mrs. Borrow on 13th October
1853 to say that while travelling abroad he had read in <i>Galignani's
Messenger</i> an account of his friend Lavengro's 'daring and heroic act in
rescuing so many from a watery grave.' 'I wish they had all been
critics,' he adds; 'he would have done just the same, and they might
perhaps have shown their gratitude when they got among his inky waves of
literature.'</p>

<p>More than this, the paragraph in the Bury St. Edmunds newspaper was
copied into the <i>Plymouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> Mail</i>, and was there read by the Borrows of
Cornwall, who had heard nothing of their relative, Thomas Borrow, the
army captain and his family, for fifty years or more. One of Borrow's
cousins by marriage, Robert Taylor of Penquite, invited him to his
father's homeland, and Borrow accepted, glad, we may be sure, of any
excuse for a renewal of his wanderings. And so on the 23rd of December
1853 Borrow made his way from Yarmouth to Plymouth by rail, and thence
walked twenty miles to Liskeard, where quite a little party of Borrow's
cousins were present to greet him. The Borrow family consisted of Henry
Borrow of Looe Doun, the father of Mrs. Taylor, William Borrow of
Trethinnick, Thomas Nicholas and Elizabeth Borrow, all first cousins,
except Anne Taylor. Anne, talking to a friend, describes Borrow on this
visit better than any one else has done:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A fine tall man of about six feet three; well-proportioned and
not stout; able to walk five miles an hour successively; rather
florid face without any hirsute appendages; hair white and
soft; eyes and eyebrows dark; good nose and very nice mouth;
well-shaped hands;&mdash;altogether a person you would notice in a
crowd.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Knapp possessed two 'notebooks' of this Cornish tour. Borrow stayed
at Penquite with his cousins from 24th December to 9th January, then he
went on a walking tour to Land's End, through Truro and Penzance; he was
back at Penquite from 26th January to 1st February, and then took a
week's tramp to Tintagel, King Arthur's Castle, and Pentire. Naturally
he made inquiries into the language, already extinct, but spoken within
the memory of the older inhabitants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> 'My relations are most excellent
people,' he wrote to his wife from London on his way back, 'but I could
not understand more than half of what they said.'</p>

<p>I have only one letter to Mrs. Borrow written during this tour:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Penquite</span>, <i>27th Janry. 1854.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I just write you a line to inform you that I
have got back safe here from the Land's End. I have received
your two letters, and hope you received mine from the Land's
End. It is probable that I shall yet visit one or two places
before I leave Cornwall. I am very much pleased with the
country. When you receive this if you please to write a line
<i>by return of post</i> I think you may; the Trethinnick people
wish me to stay with them for a day or two. When you see the
Cobbs pray remember me to them; I am sorry Horace has lost his
aunt, he will <i>miss her</i>. Love to Hen. Ever yours, dearest,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">G. Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(Keep this.)</p></div>

<p>One of Borrow's biographers, Mr. Walling, has given us the best account
of that journey through Cornwall,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and his explanation of why Borrow
did not write the Cornish book that he caused to be advertised in a
fly-leaf of <i>The Romany Rye</i>, by the discouragement arising out of the
dire failure of that book, may be accepted.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Borrow would have made
a beautiful book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> upon Cornwall. Even the title, <i>Penquite and Pentyre;
or, The Head of the Forest and the Headland</i>, has music in it. And he
had in these twenty weeks made himself wonderfully well acquainted not
only with the topography of the principality, but with its folklore and
legend. The gulf that ever separated the Borrow of the notebook and of
the unprepared letter from the Borrow of the finished manuscript was
extraordinary, and we may deplore with Mr. Walling the absence of this
among Borrow's many unwritten books.</p>

<p>Borrow was back in Yarmouth at the end of February 1854&mdash;he had not fled
the country as Dalrymple had suggested&mdash;but in July he was off again for
his great tour in Wales, in which he was accompanied by his wife and
daughter. Of that tour we must treat in another and later chapter, for
<i>Wild Wales</i> was not published until 1862. The year following his great
tour in Wales he went on a trip to the Isle of Man.</p>

<h3>IN THE ISLE OF MAN</h3>


<p>The holiday which Borrow gave himself the year following his visit to
Wales, that is to say, in September 1855, is recorded in his unpublished
diaries. He never wrote a book as the outcome of that journey, although
he caused one to be advertised under the title of <i>Bayr Jairgey and
Glion Doo: Wanderings in Search of Manx Literature</i>.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Dr. Knapp
possessed two volumes of these notebooks closely written in pencil.
These he reproduced conscientiously in his <i>Life</i>, and indeed here we
have the most satisfactory portion of his book, for the journal is
transcribed with but little modification, and so we have some thirty
pages of genuine 'Borrow' that are really very attractive reading.
Borrow, it will be remembered, learnt the Irish language as a mere
child, much to his father's disgust. Although he never loved the Irish
people, the Celtic Irish, that is to say, whose genial temperament was
so opposed to his own, he did love the Irish language, which he more
than once declared had incited him to become a student of many tongues.
He never made the mistake into which two of his biographers have fallen
of calling it 'Erse.' He was never an accurate student of the Irish
language, but among Englishmen he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> led the way in the present-day
interest in that tongue&mdash;an interest which is now so pronounced among
scholars of many nationalities, and has made in Ireland so definite a
revival of a language that for a time seemed to be on the way to
extinction. Two translations from the Irish are to be found in his
<i>Targum</i> published so far back as 1835, and many other translations from
the Irish poets were among the unpublished manuscripts that he left
behind him. It would therefore be with peculiar interest that he would
visit the Isle of Man which, at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
was an Irish-speaking land, but in 1855 was at a stage when the language
was falling fast into decay. What survived of it was still Irish with
trifling variations in the spelling of words. 'Cranu,' a tree, for
example, had become 'Cwan,' and so on&mdash;although the pronunciation was
apparently much the same. When the tall, white-haired Englishman talked
to the older inhabitants who knew something of the language they were
delighted. 'Mercy upon us,' said one old woman, 'I believe, sir, you are
of the old Manx!' Borrow was actually wandering in search of Manx
literature, as the title of the book that he announced implied. He
inquired about the old songs of the island, and of everything that
survived of its earlier language. Altogether Borrow must have had a good
time in thus following his favourite pursuit.</p>

<p>But Dr. Knapp's two notebooks, which are so largely taken up with these
philological matters, are less human than a similar notebook that has
fallen into my hands. This is a long leather pocket-book, in which,
under the title of 'Expedition to the Isle of Man,' we have, written in
pencil, a quite vivacious account of his adventures. It records that
Borrow and his wife and daughter set out through Bury to Peterborough,
Rugby, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> Liverpool. It tells of the admiration with which
Peterborough's 'noble cathedral' inspired him. Liverpool he calls a
'London in miniature':</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Strolled about town with my wife and Henrietta; wonderful docks
and quays, where all the ships of the world seemed to be
gathered&mdash;all the commerce of the world to be carried on; St.
George's Crescent; noble shops; strange people walking about,
an Herculean mulatto, for example; the old china shop; cups
with Chinese characters upon them; an horrible old Irishwoman
with naked feet; Assize Hall a noble edifice.</p></div>

<p>The party left Liverpool on 20th August, and Borrow, when in sight of
the Isle of Man, noticed a lofty ridge of mountains rising to the
clouds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Entered into conversation with two of the crew&mdash;Manx
sailors&mdash;about the Manx language; one, a very tall man, said he
knew only a very little of it as he was born on the coast, but
that his companion, who came from the interior, knew it well;
said it was a mere gibberish. This I denied, and said it was an
ancient language, and that it was like the Irish; his
companion, a shorter man, in shirt sleeves, with a sharp, eager
countenance, now opened his mouth and said I was right, and
said that I was the only gentleman whom he had ever heard ask
questions about the Manx language. I spoke several Irish words
which they understood.</p></div>

<p>When he had landed he continued his investigations, asking every peasant
he met the Manx for this or that English word:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Are you Manx?' said I. 'Yes,' he replied, 'I am Manx.' 'And
what do you call a river in Manx?' 'A river,' he replied. 'Can
you speak Manx?' I demanded. 'Yes,' he replied, 'I speak Manx.'
'And you call a river a river?' 'Yes,' said he, 'I do.' 'You
don't call it owen?' said I. 'I do not,' said he. I passed on,
and on the other side of the bridge went for some time along an
avenue of trees, passing by a stone water-mill, till I came to
a public-house on the left hand. Seeing a woman looking out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the window, I asked her to what place the road led. 'To
Castletown,' she replied. 'And what do you call the river in
Manx?' said I. 'We call it an owen,' said she. 'So I thought,'
I replied, and after a little further discourse returned, as
the night was now coming fast on.</p></div>

<p>One man whom Borrow asked if there were any poets in Man replied that he
did not believe there were, that the last Manx poet had died some time
ago at Kirk Conoshine, and this man had translated Parnell's <i>Hermit</i>
beautifully, and the translation had been printed. He inquired about the
Runic Stones, which he continually transcribed. Under date Thursday,
30th August, we find the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This day year I ascended Snowdon, and this morning, which is
very fine, I propose to start on an expedition to Castletown
and to return by Peel.</p></div>

<p>Very gladly would I follow Borrow more in detail through this
interesting holiday by means of his diary,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> but it would make my
book too long. As he had his wife and daughter with him there are no
letters by him from the island. But wherever Borrow went he met people
who were interested in him, and so I find the following letter among his
Papers, which he received a year after his return:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">3 <span class="smcap">Albert Terrace, Douglas</span>, <i>11 February 1856.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;If experience on report has made you acquainted
with the nature of true Celtic indolence and procrastination
you will be prepared to learn, without surprise, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> your
Runic stone still remains unerected.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> In vain have I called
time after time upon the clerk of Braddan&mdash;in vain have I
expostulated. Nothing could I get but fair words and fair
promises. First he was very rheumatic, having, according to his
own account, contracted his dolorous aches in the course of
that five-hours' job under your superintendence in the steeple,
where, it seems, a merciless wind is in the habit of disporting
itself. Then the weather was so unfavourable, then his wife was
ailing, etc., etc. On Saturday, however, armed with your potent
note, I made another attack, and obtained a promise that the
stone should be in its right place on that day of the week
following. So I await the result. My own private impression is
that if we see the achievement complete by Easter there will be
much cause for thankfulness.</p>

<p>Many thanks for <i>The Illustrated News</i>; I read the article with
great interest, and subsequently studied the stone itself as
well as its awkward position in its nook in the steeple would
allow me. Your secret, I need hardly say, was faithfully kept
till the receipt of the news assured me that it need be a
secret no longer. I may just mention that the clerk thinks that
the sovereign you left will be quite enough to defray the
expenses. I think so too; at least if there be anything more it
cannot be worth mentioning. Though no Manxman myself still I
shall take the liberty of thanking you in the name of Mona&mdash;may
I not add in the name of Antiquarian Science too&mdash;for your
liberality in this matter. Mrs. Borrow, I trust, is
convalescent by this time, and Miss Clarke well. With our
united kind regards, believe me, my dear Sir, very sincerely
yours,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">S. W. Wanton.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>And even three years later we find that Borrow has not forgotten the
friends of that Manx holiday. This letter is from the Vicar of Malew in
acknowledgment of a copy of <i>The Romany Rye</i> published in the interval:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Malew Vicarage, Ballasalla, Isle of Man</span>, <i>27 Jany. 1859.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I return you my most hearty thanks for your most
handsome present of <i>Romany Rye</i>, and no less handsome letter
relative to your tour in the Isle of Man and the literature of
the Manx. Both I value very highly, and from both I shall
derive useful hints for my introduction to the new edition of
the <i>Manx Grammar</i>. I hope you will have no objection to my
quoting a passage or two from the advertisement of your
forthcoming book; and if I receive no intimation of your
dissent, I shall take it for granted that I have your kind
permission. The whole notice is so apposite to my purpose, and
would be so interesting to every Manxman, that I would fain
insert the whole bodily, did the Author and the limits of an
Introduction permit. The <i>Grammar</i> will, I think, go to press
in March next. It is to be published under the auspices of 'The
Manx Society,' instituted last year 'for the publication of
National documents of the Isle of Man.' As soon as it is
printed I hope to beg the favour of your acceptance of a
copy.&mdash;I am, my dear Sir, your deeply obliged humble servant,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">William Gill.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>The letter from Mr. Wanton directs us to the issue of <i>The Illustrated
London News</i> for 8th December 1855, where we find the following note on
the Isle of Man, obviously contributed to that journal by Borrow,
together with an illustration of the Runic Stone, which is also
reproduced here:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-0339-1.jpg" width="350" height="156" alt="RUNIC STONE FROM THE ISLE OF MAN" title="" />
<span class="caption">RUNIC STONE FROM THE ISLE OF MAN</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>ANCIENT RUNIC STONE, RECENTLY FOUND IN THE ISLE OF MAN</p>

<p>For upwards of seventy years a stone which, as far as it could
be discerned, had the appearance of what is called a Danish
cross, has been known to exist in the steeple of Kirk Braddan,
Isle of Man. It was partly bedded in mortar and stones above
the lintel of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> doorway leading to a loft above the gallery.
On the 19th of November it was removed from its place under the
superintendence of an English gentleman who had been travelling
about the island. It not only proved to be a Northern cross,
but a Runic one; that is, it bore a Runic inscription. As soon
as the stone had been taken out of the wall, the gentleman in
question copied the inscription and translated it, to the best
of his ability, in the presence of the church clerk who had
removed the stone. The Runes were in beautiful preservation,
and looked as fresh as if they had just come out of the
workshop of Orokoin Gaut. Unfortunately the upper part of the
cross was partly broken, so that the original inscription was
not entire. In the inscription, as it is, the concluding word
is mutilated; in its original state it was probably 'sonr,'
son; the Runic character which answers to <i>s</i> being distinct,
and likewise the greater part of one which stands for <i>o</i>. Yet
there is reason for believing that sonr was not the concluding
word of the original, but the penultimate, and that the
original terminated with some Norwegian name: we will suppose
'Olf.' The writing at present on the stone is to this effect:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">OTR. RISTI. KROS. THUNU. AFT. FRUKA<br /></span>
<span class="i0">FATHOR. SIN. IN. THORWIAORI. S ... (SONR OLFS)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">OTR RAISED THIS CROSS TO FRUKI HIS FATHER,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">THE THORWIAORI, SO(N OF OLF).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The names Otr and Fruki have never before been found on any of
the Runic stones in the Isle of Man. The words <i>In</i> ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Thorwiaori, which either denote the place where the individual
to whom they relate lived, or one of his attributes or
peculiarities, will perhaps fling some light on the words In
... Aruthur, which appear on the beautiful cross which stands
nearly opposite the door of Kirk Braddan.</p>

<p>The present cross is curiously ornamented. The side which we
here present to the public bears two monsters, perhaps intended
to represent dragons, tied with a single cord, which passes
round the neck and body of one whose head is slightly averted,
whilst, though it passes round the body of the other, it leaves
the neck free. Little at present can be said about the other
side of the stone, which is still in some degree covered with
the very hard mortar in which it was found lying. The gentleman
of whom we have already spoken, before leaving the island, made
arrangements for placing the stone beside the other cross,
which has long been considered one of the principal ornaments
of the beautiful churchyard of Braddan.</p></div>

<h3>OULTON BROAD AND YARMOUTH</h3>

<p>George Borrow wandered far and wide, but he always retraced his
footsteps to East Anglia, of which he was so justly proud. From his
marriage in 1840 until his death in 1881 he lived twenty-seven years at
Oulton or at Yarmouth. 'It is on sand alone that the sea strikes its
true music,' Borrow once remarked, 'Norfolk sand'&mdash;and it was in the
waves and on the sands of the Norfolk coast that Borrow spent the
happiest hours of his restless life. Oulton Cottage is only about two
miles from Lowestoft, and so, walking or driving, these places were
quite near one another. But both are in Suffolk. Was it because
Yarmouth&mdash;ten miles distant&mdash;is in Norfolk that it was always selected
for seaside residence? I suspect that the careful Mrs. Borrow found a
wider selection of 'apartments' at a moderate price. In any case the sea
air of Yarmouth was good for his wife, and the sea bathing was good for
him, and so we find that husband and wife had seven separate residences
at Yarmouth during the years of Oulton life.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But Oulton was ever to
be Borrow's headquarters, even though between 1860 and 1874 he had a
house in London. Borrow was thirty-seven years of age when he settled
down at Oulton.</p>

<p>He was, he tells us in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, 'in tolerably easy
circumstances and willing to take some rest after a life of labour.'
Their home was a cottage on the Broad, for the Hall, which was also Mrs.
Borrow's property, was let on lease to a farmer.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The cottage,
however, was an extremely pleasant residence with a lawn running down to
the river. A more substantial house has been built on this site since
Borrow's day. The summer-house is generally assumed to be the same, but
has certainly been reroofed since the time when Henrietta Clarke drew
the picture of it that is reproduced in this book. Probably the whole
summer-house is new, but at any rate the present structure stands on the
site of the old one. Here Borrow did his work, wrote and wrote and
wrote, until he had, as he said, 'Mountains of manuscripts.' Here first
of all he completed <i>The Zincali</i> (1841), commenced in Seville; then he
wrote or rather arranged <i>The Bible in Spain</i> (1843), and then at long
intervals, diversified by extensive travel holidays, he wrote <i>Lavengro</i>
(1851), <i>The Romany Rye</i> (1857), and <i>Wild Wales</i> (1860),&mdash;these are the
five books and their dates that we most associate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> with Borrow's sojourn
at Oulton. When <i>Wild Wales</i> was published he had removed to London.
Borrow brought with him to Oulton, as we have said, a beautiful Arabian
horse, Sidi Habismilk, and a Jewish servant, Hayim Ben Attar. The horse
remained to delight the neighbourhood. It followed Borrow like a dog
when he was not riding it. The Jew had soon had enough of this rural
retreat and sighed for a sunnier clime. Thus, under date 1843, I find
among my Borrow Papers the following letter to a firm of shipbrokers:</p>


<h3>To Messrs. Nickols and Marshal, London.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>4th July 1843.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;Having received a communication from Liverpool from
Harry Palmer, Esq., stating that you are his agents in London,
and that as such he has requested you to communicate with us
relative to a passage required for a man sent to Cadiz or
Gibraltar, I shall as briefly as possible state the
particulars. Mr. Palmer names &pound;7 or &pound;8 as the lowest which he
thinks it will cost us to get him to Gibraltar or Cadiz. This
we consider is a large sum when it is to be remembered that he
is to fare as the ship's crew fare, and with the exception of a
berth to lie down in, no difference is required at this
beautiful season of the year. I must here state as an excuse
for the above remark that this man came to England at his own
particular desire. I have been at much expense about him. He
has had good wages, but now that he wants to get back to his
own country the whole expense is thrown upon me, as he has
saved no money, and we wish it to be clearly understood by the
captain who will take him that when he is once off from England
and his passage paid that we will be responsible for no further
expense whatever. We do not want to get him to Tangier, as we
shall put money in his pocket which will enable him to pay for
a passage across if he wishes to go there, but we will pay only
to Gibraltar or Cadiz. A steam vessel sails from Yarmouth
bridge every Wednesday and Friday. This will be the most direct
and safe way to send him to London,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> and then trouble you to
have him met at the steamer and conveyed to the ship at once in
which he is to have his passage. All therefore that remains to
be done is to trouble you to give us a few days' notice with
time to get him up per Yarmouth steamer. I beg to thank you for
the willingness you expressed to Mr. Palmer to assist me in
this affair by getting as cheap a passage as you can and seeing
him on board and the passage <i>not</i> paid till the ship sails.
You no doubt can quite understand our anxious feelings upon the
subject from your connection with shipping, and consequently
knowing what foreigners generally are.&mdash;I am, Sir, Your
obedient servant,</p></div>

<p>Then we have the following document with which his cautious master
provided himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Statement of Hayim Ben Attar previous to his leaving England.</p>

<p>I declare that it was my own wish to come to England with my
master G. H. Borrow, who offered to send me to my own country
before he left Spain. That I have regularly received the
liberal wages he agreed to give me from the first of my coming
to him. That I have been treated justly and kindly by him
during my stay in England, and that I return to my country at
my own wish and request, and at my master's expense. To this
statement, which I declare to be true, I sign my name.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hayim
Ben Attar</span>.</p>

<p>Declared before me this 9 of August 1843.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">W. M. Hammond</span>, Magistrate for Great Yarmouth.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>I find a letter among my Papers which bears no name, and is probably a
draft. It contains an interesting reference to Hayim Ben Attar, and
hence I give it here:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 17th inst., which my friend, Mr. Murray, has just
forwarded to me. I am afraid that you attribute to me powers
and information which I am by no means conscious of possessing;
I should feel disposed to entertain a much higher opinion of
myself than I at present do could I for a moment conceive
myself gifted with the talent of inducing any endeavour to
dismiss from his mind a theory of the reasonableness of which
appears to him obvious. Nevertheless, as you do me the honour
of asking my opinion with respect to the theory of Gypsies
being Jews by origin, I hasten to answer to the following
effect. I am not prepared to acknowledge the reasonableness of
any theory which cannot be borne out by the slightest proof.
Against the theory may be offered the following arguments which
I humbly consider to be unanswerable. The Gypsies differ from
the Jews in feature and complexion&mdash;in whatever part of the
world you find the Gypsy you recognise him at once by his
features which are virtually the same&mdash;the Jew likewise has a
peculiar countenance by which at once he may be distinguished
as a Jew, but which would certainly prevent the probability of
his being considered as a scion of the Gypsy stock&mdash;in proof of
which assertion I can adduce the following remarkable instance.</p>

<p>I have in my service a Jew, a native of Northern Africa. Last
summer I took him with me to an encampment of Romanies or
Gypsies near my home at Oulton in Suffolk. I introduced him to
the Chief, and said, Are ye not dui patos (two brothers). The
Gypsy passed his hand over the Jew's face and stared him in the
eyes, then turning to me he answered&mdash;we are not two brothers,
not two brothers&mdash;this man is no rom&mdash;I believe him to be a
Jew. Now this Gypsy has been in the habit of seeing German and
English Jews who must have been separated from their African
brothers for a term of 1700 years&mdash;yet he recognised the Jew of
Troy for what he was&mdash;a Jew&mdash;and without hesitation declared
that he was not a rom; the Jews, therefore, and the Gypsies
have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> each their peculiar and distinctive features, which
disprove the impossibility of their having been originally the
same people.&mdash;Your obedient servant,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>I find also in this connection a letter from Tangier addressed to 'Mr.
H. George Borrow' under date 2nd November 1847. It tells us that the
worthy Jew longs once again to see the 'dear face' of his master. Since
he left his service he has married and has two sons, but he is anxious
to return to England if that same master will find him work. We can
imagine that by this time Borrow had had enough of Hayim Ben Attar, and
that his answer was not encouraging.</p>

<p>But by far the best glimpses of Borrow during these years of Suffolk
life are those contained in a letter contributed by his friend,
Elizabeth Harvey, to <i>The Eastern Daily Press</i> of Norwich over the
initials 'E.H.':<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When I knew Mr. Borrow he lived in a lovely cottage whose
garden sloped down to the edge of Oulton Broad. He had a wooden
room built on the very margin of the water, where he had many
strange old books in various languages. I remember he once put
one before me, telling me to read it. 'Oh, I can't,' I replied.
He said, 'You ought, it's your own language.' It was an old
Saxon book. He used to spend a great deal of his time in this
room writing, translating, and at times singing strange words
in a stentorian voice, while passers-by on the lake would stop
to listen with astonishment and curiosity to the singular
sounds. He was 6 feet 3 inches, a splendid man, with handsome
hands and feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> He wore neither whiskers, beard, nor
moustache. His features were very handsome, but his eyes were
peculiar, being round and rather small, but very piercing, and
now and then fierce. He would sometimes sing one of his Romany
songs, shake his fist at me and look quite wild. Then he would
ask, 'Aren't you afraid of me?' 'No, not at all,' I would say.
Then he would look just as gentle and kind, and say, 'God bless
you, I would not hurt a hair of your head,' He was an expert
swimmer, and used to go out bathing, and dive under water an
immense time. On one occasion he was bathing with a friend, and
after plunging in nothing was seen of him for some while. His
friend began to be alarmed, when he heard Borrow's voice a long
way off exclaiming, 'There, if that had been written in one of
my books they would have said it was a lie, wouldn't they?' He
was very fond of animals, and the animals were fond of him. He
would go for a walk with two dogs and a cat following him. The
cat would go a quarter of a mile or so and then turn back home.
He delighted to go for long walks and enter into conversation
with any one he might meet on the road, and lead them into
histories of their lives, belongings, and experiences. When
they used some word peculiar to Norfolk (or Suffolk) countrymen
he would say, 'Why, that's a Danish word.' By and by the man
would use another peculiar expression, 'Why, that's Saxon'; a
little later on another, 'Why, that's French.' And he would
add, 'Why, what a wonderful man you are to speak so many
languages.' One man got very angry, but Mr. Borrow was quite
unconscious that he had given any offence. He spoke a great
number of languages, and at the Exhibition of 1851, whither he
went with his stepdaughter, he spoke to the different
foreigners in their own language, until his daughter saw some
of them whispering together and looking as if they thought he
was 'uncanny,' and she became alarmed and drew him away. He,
however, did not like to hear the English language adulterated
with the introduction of foreign words. If his wife or friends
used a foreign word in conversation, he would say, 'What's
that, trying to come over me with strange languages.'</p>

<p>I have gone for many a walk with him at Oulton. He used to go
on, singing to himself or quite silent, quite forgetting me
until he came to a high hill, when he would turn round, seize
my hand, and drag me up. Then he would sit down and enjoy the
prospect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> He was a great lover of nature, and very fond of his
trees. He quite fretted if, by some mischance, he lost one. He
did not shoot or hunt. He rode his Arab at times, but walking
was his favourite exercise. He was subject to fits of nervous
depression. At times also he suffered from sleeplessness, when
he would get up and walk to Norwich (25 miles), and return the
next night recovered. His fondness for the gypsies has been
noticed. At Oulton he used to allow them to encamp in his
grounds, and he would visit them, with a friend or alone, talk
to them in Romany, and sing Romany songs. He was very fond of
ghost stories and believed in the supernatural. He was keenly
sympathetic with any one who was in trouble or suffering. He
was no man of business and very guileless, and led a very
harmless, quiet life at Oulton, spending his evenings at home
with his wife and stepdaughter, generally reading all the
evening. He was very hospitable in his own home, and detested
meanness. He was moderate in eating and drinking, took very
little breakfast, but ate a very great quantity at dinner, and
then had only a draught of cold water before going to bed. He
wrote much in praise of 'strong ale,' and was very fond of good
ale, of whose virtue he had a great idea. Once I was speaking
of a lady who was attached to a gentleman, and he asked, 'Well,
did he make her an offer?' 'No,' I said. 'Ah,' he exclaimed,
'if she had given him some good ale he would.' But although he
talked so much about ale I never saw him take much. He was very
temperate, and would eat what was set before him, often not
thinking of what he was doing, and he never refused what was
offered him. He took much pleasure in music, especially of a
light and lively character. My sister would sing to him, and I
played. One piece he seemed never to tire of hearing. It was a
polka, 'The Redowa,' I think, and when I had finished he used
to say, 'Play that again, E&mdash;&mdash;.' He was very polite and
gentlemanly in ladies' society, and we all liked him.</p></div>

<p>It is refreshing to read this tribute, from which I have omitted nothing
salient, because a very disagreeable Borrow has somehow grown up into a
tradition. I note in reading some of the reviews of Dr. Knapp's <i>Life</i>
that he is charged, or half-charged, with suppressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> facts, 'because
they do not reflect credit upon the subject of his biography.' Now,
there were really no facts to suppress. Borrow was at times a very
irritable man, he was a very self-centred one. His egotism might even be
pronounced amazing by those who had never met an author. But those of us
who have, recognise that with very few exceptions they are all egotists,
although some conceal it from the unobservant more deftly than others.
Let me recall Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson's verses on 'My Poet.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He came; I met him face to face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shrank amazed, dismayed; I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No patient depth, no tender grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No prophet of the eternal law.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But weakness, fretting to be great,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Self-consciousness with sidelong eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The impotence that dares not wait<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For honour, crying 'This is I.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tyrant of a sullen hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He frowned away our mild content;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And insight only gave him power<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see the slights that were not meant.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many successful and unsuccessful authors, living and dead, are here
described, and Borrow was far from one of the worst. He was quarrelsome,
and I rather like him for that. If he was a good hater he was also a
very loyal friend, as we find Miss Elizabeth Harvey and, in after years,
Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton testifying. Moreover, Borrow had a grievance
of a kind that has not often befallen a man of his literary power. He
had written a great book in <i>Lavengro</i>, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> critics and the public
refused to recognise that it was a great book. Many authors of power
have died young and unrecognised; but recognition has usually come to
those men of genius who have lived into middle age. It did not come to
Borrow. He had therefore a right to be soured. This sourness found
expression in many ways. Borrow, most sound of churchmen, actually
quarrelled with his vicar over the tempers of their respective dogs.
Both the vicar, the Rev. Edwin Proctor Denniss, and his parishioner
wrote one another acrid letters. Here is Borrow's parting shot:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Circumstances over which Mr. Borrow has at present no control
will occasionally bring him and his family under the same roof
with Mr. Denniss; that roof, however, is the roof of the House
of God, and the prayers of the Church of England are wholesome
from whatever mouth they may proceed.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p></div>

<p>Surely that is a kind of quarrel we have all had in our day, and we
think ourselves none the less virtuous in consequence. Then there was
Borrow's very natural ambition to be made a magistrate of Suffolk. He
tells Mr. John Murray in 1842 that he has caught a bad cold by getting
up at night in pursuit of poachers and thieves. 'A terrible
neighbourhood this,' he adds, 'not a magistrate dare do his duty.' And
so in the next year he wrote again to the same correspondent:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Present my compliments to Mr. Gladstone, and tell him that the
<i>Bible in Spain</i> will have no objection to becoming one of the
'Great Unpaid.'</p></div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, although he had admired <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, and indeed
had even suggested the modification of one of its sentences, did
nothing. Lockhart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> Lord Clarendon, and others who were applied to were
equally powerless or indifferent. Borrow never got his magistracy.
To-day no man of equal eminence in literature could possibly have failed
of so slight an ambition. Moreover, Borrow wanted to be a J.P., not from
mere snobbery as many might, but for a definite, practical object. I am
afraid he would not have made a very good magistrate, and perhaps
inquiry had made that clear to the authorities. Lastly, there was
Borrow's quarrel with the railway which came through his estate. He had
thoughts of removing to Bury, where Dr. Hake lived, or to Troston Hall,
once the home of the interesting Capell Lofft. But he was not to leave
Oulton. In intervals of holidays, journeys, and of sojourn in Yarmouth
it was to remain his home to the end. In 1849 his mother joined him at
Oulton. She had resided for thirty-three years at the Willow Lane
Cottage. She was now seventy-seven years of age. She lived-on near her
son as a tenant of his tenant at Oulton Hall until her death nine years
later, dying in 1858 in her eighty-seventh year. She lies buried in
Oulton Churchyard, with a tomb thus inscribed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sacred to the memory of Ann Borrow, widow of Captain Thomas
Borrow. She died on the 16th of August 1858, aged eighty-six
years and seven months. She was a good wife and a good mother.</p></div>

<p>During these years at Oulton we have many glimpses of Borrow. Dr.
Jessopp, for example, has recorded in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i><a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> newspaper his
own hero-worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> for the author of <i>Lavengro</i>, whom he was never to
meet. This enthusiasm for <i>Lavengro</i> was shared by certain of his
Norfolk friends of those days:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Among those friends were two who, I believe, are still alive,
and who about the year 1846 set out, without telling me of
their intention, on a pilgrimage to Oulton to see George Borrow
in the flesh. In those days the journey was not an
inconsiderable one; and though my friends must have known that
I would have given my ears to be of the party, I suppose they
kept their project to themselves for reasons of their own. Two,
they say, are company and three are none; two men could ride in
a gig for sixty miles without much difficulty, and an odd man
often spoils sport. At any rate, they left me out, and one day
they came back full of malignant pride and joy and exultation,
and they flourished their information before me with boastings
and laughter at my ferocious jealousy; for they had seen, and
talked with, and eaten and drunk with, and sat at the feet of
the veritable George Borrow, and had grasped his mighty hand.
To me it was too provoking. But what had they to tell?</p>

<p>They found him at Oulton, living, as they affirmed, in a house
which belonged to Mrs. Borrow and which her first husband had
left her. The household consisted of himself, his wife, and his
wife's daughter; and among his other amusements he employed
himself in training some young horses to follow him about like
dogs and come at the call of his whistle. As my two friends
were talking with him Borrow sounded his whistle in a paddock
near the house, which, if I remember rightly, was surrounded by
a low wall. Immediately two beautiful horses came bounding over
the fence and trotted up to their master. One put his nose into
Borrow's outstretched hand and the other kept snuffing at his
pockets in expectation of the usual bribe for confidence and
good behaviour. Borrow could not but be flattered by the young
Cambridge men paying him the frank homage they offered, and he
treated them with the robust and cordial hospitality
characteristic of the man. One or two things they learnt which
I do not feel at liberty to repeat.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Arthur W. Upcher of Sheringham Hall, Cromer, also provided in <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i><a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> a quaint reminiscence of Borrow in which he recalled that
Lavengro had called upon Miss Anna Gurney. This lady had, assuredly with
less guile, treated him much as Frances Cobbe would have done. She had
taken down an Arabic grammar, and put it into his hand, asking for
explanation of some difficult point which he tried to decipher; but
meanwhile she talked to him continuously. 'I could not,' said Borrow,
'study the Arabic grammar and listen to her at the same time, so I threw
down the book and ran out of the room.' He soon after met Mr. Upcher, to
whom he made an interesting revelation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He told us there were three personages in the world whom he had
always a desire to see; two of these had slipped through his
fingers, so he was determined to see the third. 'Pray, Mr.
Borrow, who were they?' He held up three fingers of his left
hand and pointed them off with the forefinger of the right: the
first Daniel O'Connell, the second Lamplighter (the sire of
Phosphorus, Lord Berners's winner of the Derby), the third,
Anna Gurney. The first two were dead and he had not seen them;
now he had come to see Anna Gurney, and this was the end of his
visit.</p></div>

<p>Mr. William Mackay, who now lives at Oulton Broad, where he has heard
all the village gossip about Borrow and his <i>m&eacute;nage</i>, and we may hope
has discounted it fully, furnishes me with the following impression of
Borrow, which is of a much later date than those I have just given:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I met Borrow in 1869 at the house of Dr. Gordon Hake at Coombe
End, near the top of Roehampton Lane, Wimbledon Common. My
recollection is of a tall, broad-shouldered old man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> stooping
a little, engaged in reading a small volume held close to his
eyes. Something Yorkshire about his powerful build, but little
tolerance or benevolence in his expression. A fine, strongly
marked clean shaven face, but with no kindliness or sense of
humour indicated in its lines. In loosely made broadcloth he
gave the idea of a nonconformist minister&mdash;a Unitarian, judging
from the intellectuality betrayed in his countenance. To me he
was always civil and, even, genial, for he did not know that I
was a writing fellow. But to others casually met he seemed to
be invariably and intolerably rude. He could not brook
contradiction&mdash;particularly on religious topics. He was an
earnest believer. But it was in the God of Battles that he
believed. And he would be delighted at any time to prove in a
stand-up fight the honesty of his convictions. In the union of
a deep religious fervour with an overwhelming love of
fighting&mdash;sheer physical hand-to-hand fighting&mdash;he was an
interesting study. In this curious blending of what appear to
be opposite qualities he resembled General Gordon, who, by the
way, was a cousin of Dr. Gordon Hake at whose place I met
Borrow.</p>

<p>He was a splendid liar too. Not in the ordinary domestic
meaning of the word. But he lied largely, picturesquely, like
Baron Munchausen. That is one of the reasons that he did not
take to the literary persons whom he met at Hake's. Perhaps he
was afraid that some of them would steal his thunder, or
perhaps he had a contempt for their serious pose. But to those
whom he did not suspect of literary leanings he lied
delightfully. That fine boys' book, <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, is, I
should say, chiefly lies. I have heard him reel off adventures
as amazing as any in the Spanish reminiscences, related as
having happened on the very Common which we were crossing.
Theodore Watts, who first met Borrow at Hake's, appears to have
got on all right with him. But then Watts would get on with
anybody. Besides, the two men had a common topic in Romany
lore. But toward the literary man in general his attitude was
pretty much that of Carlyle. He was contemptuous towards those
who followed his own trade.</p></div>

<p>At one moment of the correspondence we obtain an interesting glimpse of
a great man of science. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> Darwin sent the following inquiry through
Dr. Hooker, afterwards Sir Joseph Hooker, and it reached Borrow through
his friend Thomas Brightwell:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Is there any Dog in Spain closely like our English Pointer, in
<i>shape</i> and size, and <i>habits</i>,&mdash;namely in pointing, backing,
and not giving tongue. Might I be permitted to quote Mr.
Borrow's answer to the query? Has the improved English pointer
been introduced into Spain?</p></div>

<p>Borrow took constant holidays during these Oulton days. We have
elsewhere noted his holidays in Eastern Europe, in the Isle of Man, in
Wales, and in Cornwall. Letters from other parts of England would be
welcome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> but I can only find two, and these are but scraps. Both are
addressed to his wife, each without date:</p>

</p>

<p>One of the very last letters of Borrow that I possess is to an unknown
correspondent. It is from a rough 'draft' in his handwriting:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Oulton, Lowestoft,</span> <i>May 1875.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the eighth of March I only lately
received, otherwise I should have answered it sooner. In it you
mention Chamberlayne's work, containing versions of the Lord's
Prayer translated into a hundred languages, and ask whether I
can explain why the one which purports to be a rendering into
Waldensian is evidently made in some dialect of the Gaelic. To
such explanation as I can afford you are welcome, though
perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> you will not deem it very satisfactory. I have been
acquainted with Chamberlayne's work for upwards of forty years.
I first saw it at St. Petersburg in 1834, and the translation
in question very soon caught my attention. I at first thought
that it was an attempt at imposition, but I soon relinquished
that idea. I remembered that Helvetia was a great place for
Gaelic. I do not mean in the old time when the Gael possessed
the greater part of Europe, but at a long subsequent period:
Switzerland was converted to Christianity by Irish monks, the
most active and efficient of whom was Gall. These people
founded schools in which together with Christianity the Irish
or Gaelic language was taught. In process of time, though the
religion flourished, the Helveto Gaelic died away, but many
pieces in that tongue survived, some of which might still
probably be found in the recesses of St. Gall. The noble abbey
is named after the venerable apostle of Christianity in
Helvetia; so I deemed it very possible that the version in
question might be one of the surviving fruits of Irish
missionary labour in Helvetia, not but that I had my doubts,
and still have, principally from observing that the language
though certainly not modern does not exhibit any decided marks
of high antiquity. It is much to be regretted that Chamberlayne
should have given the version to the world under a title so
calculated to perplex and mislead as that which it bears, and
without even stating how or where he obtained it. This, sir, is
all I have to say on the very obscure subject about which you
have done me the honour to consult me.&mdash;Yours truly,</p></div>

Hall, but he never lived here. Oulton Hall was the name given to the
farm house which went with Oulton Hall Farm. 'Old inhabitants,' writes
Mr. William Mackay of Oulton Broad to me, 'remember that seventy years
ago it was occupied by Skepper, who was succeeded by Grimmer, who was
succeeded by Smith.' 'I can find no one,' continues Mr. Mackay, 'who
recollects old Mrs. Borrow lodging at the farm house. But what more
likely? And it was characteristic of Borrow&mdash;don't you think?&mdash;that he
should hold out "Oulton Hall" as an address to those who were not likely
to visit him.' When Mrs. Borrow, senior, was persuaded to leave Willow
Lane, Norwich, for Oulton, her son took lodgings for her at the 'Hall,'
and here she died. Very commonplace farm houses in East Anglia are
frequently called 'halls,' to the great amazement of visitors from other
counties, although there are some very noble ones, as, for example,
Kirkstead, Swineshead, Parham and Dalling.</p></div>

sending your servant I have requested Messrs. Nickols and Marshal to
attend to any communication you may make to them, who will do their
utmost to get him out at the least possible expense, and pay the passage

for his passage to Tangier. As Gibraltar would be as convenient as
Cadiz, have little doubt Messrs. Nickols and Co. would be able to get
him out for &pound;7 or &pound;8. I have a vessel now loading in this port for

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND</h3>


<p>Borrow has himself given us&mdash;in <i>Lavengro</i>&mdash;a picturesque record of his
early experiences in Scotland. It is passing strange that he published
no account of his two visits to the North in maturer years. Why did he
not write <i>Wild Scotland</i> as a companion volume to <i>Wild Wales</i>? He
preserved in little leather pocket-books or leather-covered
exercise-books copious notes of both tours. Two of his notebooks came
into the possession of the late Dr. Knapp, Borrow's first biographer,
and are thus described in his Bibliography:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Note Book of a Tour in Scotland, the Orkneys and Shetland in
Oct. and Dec. 1858.</i> 1 large vol. leather.</p>

<p><i>Note Book of Tours around Belfast and the Scottish Borders
from Stranraer to Berwick-upon-Tweed in July and August 1866.</i>
1 vol. leather.</p></div>

<p>Of these Dr. Knapp made use only to give the routes of Borrow's journeys
so far as he was able to interpret them. It may be that he was doubtful
as to whether his purchase of the manuscript carried with it the
copyright of its contents, as it assuredly did not; it may be that he
quailed before the minute and almost undecipherable handwriting. But
similar notebooks are in my possession, and there are, happily, in
these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> days typists&mdash;you pay them by the hour, and it means an infinity
of time and patience&mdash;who will copy the most minute and the most obscure
documents. There are some of the notebooks of the Scottish tour of 1858
before me, and what is of far more importance&mdash;Borrow's letters to his
wife while on this tour. Borrow lost his mother in August 1858, and this
event was naturally a great blow to his heart. A week or two later he
suffered a cruel blow to his pride also, nothing less than the return of
the manuscript of his much-prized translation from the Welsh of <i>The
Sleeping Bard</i>&mdash;and this by his 'prince of publishers,' John Murray.
'There is no money in it,' said the publisher, and he was doubtless
right.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The two disasters were of different character, but both
unhinged him. He had already written <i>Wild Wales</i>, although it was not
to be published for another four years. He had caused to be
advertised&mdash;in 1857&mdash;a book on Cornwall, but it was never written in any
definitive form, and now our author had lost heart, and the Cornish
book&mdash;<i>Penquite and Pentyre</i>&mdash;and the Scots book never saw the light. In
these autumn months of 1858 geniality and humour had parted from Borrow;
this his diary makes clear. He was ill. His wife urged a tour in
Scotland, and he prepared himself for a rough, simple journey, of a kind
quite different from the one in Wales. The north of Scotland in the
winter was scarcely to be thought of for his wife and stepdaughter
Henrietta. He tells us in one of these diaries that he walked 'several
hundred miles in the Highlands.' His wife and daughter were with him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Wales, as every reader of <i>Wild Wales</i> will recall, but the Scots tour
was meant to be a more formidable pilgrimage, and they went to Great
Yarmouth instead. The first half of the tour&mdash;that of September&mdash;is
dealt with in letters to his wife, the latter half is reflected in his
diary. The letters show Borrow's experiences in the earlier part of his
journey, and from his diaries we learn that he was in Oban on 22nd
October, Aberdeen on 5th November, Inverness on the 9th, and thence he
went to Tain, Dornoch, Wick, John o'Groat's, and to the island towns,
Stromness, Kirkwall, and Lerwick. He was in Shetland on the 1st of
December&mdash;altogether a bleak, cheerless journey, we may believe, even
for so hardy a tramp as Borrow, and the tone of the following extract
from one of his rough notebooks in my possession may perhaps be
explained by the circumstance. Borrow is on the way to Loch Laggan and
visits a desolate churchyard, Coll Harrie, to see the tomb of John
Macdonnel or Ian Lom:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was on a Highland hill in an old Popish burying-ground. I
entered the ruined church, disturbed a rabbit crouching under
an old tombstone&mdash;it ran into a hole, then came out running
about like wild&mdash;quite frightened&mdash;made room for it to run out
by the doorway, telling it I would not hurt it&mdash;went out again
and examined the tombs.... Would have examined much more but
the wind and rain blew horribly, and I was afraid that my hat,
if not my head, would be blown into the road over the hill.
Quitted the place of old Highland Popish devotion&mdash;descended
the hill again with great difficulty&mdash;grass slippery and the
ground here and there quaggy, resumed the road&mdash;village&mdash;went
to the door of house looking down the valley&mdash;to ask its
name&mdash;knock&mdash;people came out, a whole family, looking sullen
and all savage. The stout, tall young man with the grey savage
eyes&mdash;civil questions&mdash;half-savage answers&mdash;village's name
Achaluarach&mdash;the neighbourhood&mdash;all Catholic&mdash;chiefly
Macdonnels; said the English,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> <i>my countrymen</i>, had taken the
whole country&mdash;'but not without paying for it,' I replied&mdash;said
I was soaking wet with a kind of sneer, but never asked me in.
I said I cared not for wet. A savage, brutal Papist and a hater
of the English&mdash;the whole family with bad countenances&mdash;a tall
woman in the background probably the mother of them all. Bade
him good-day, he made no answer and I went away. Learnt that
the river's name was Spean.</p></div>

<p>He passed through Scotland in a disputative vein, which could not have
made him a popular traveller. He tells a Roman Catholic of the Macdonnel
clan to read his Bible and 'trust in Christ, not in the Virgin Mary and
graven images.' He went up to another man who accosted him with the
remark that 'It is a soft day,' and said, 'You should not say a "soft"
day, but a wet day.' Even the Spanish, for whom he had so much contempt
and scorn when he returned from the Peninsula, are 'in many things a
wise people'&mdash;after his experiences of the Scots. There is abundance of
Borrow's prejudice, intolerance, and charm in this fragment of a
diary<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>; but the extract I have given is of additional interest as
showing how Borrow wrote all his books. The notebooks that he wrote in
Spain and Wales were made up of similar disjointed jottings. Here is a
note of more human character interspersed with Borrow's diatribes upon
the surliness of the Scots. He is at Invergarry, on the Banks of Loch
Oich. It is the 5th of October:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dinner of real haggis; meet a conceited schoolmaster. This
night, or rather in the early morning, I saw in the dream of my
sleep my dear departed mother&mdash;she appeared to be coming out of
her little sleeping-room at Oulton Hall&mdash;overjoyed I gave a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
cry and fell down at her knee, but my agitation was so great
that it burst the bonds of sleep, and I awoke.</p></div>

<p>But the letters to Mrs. Borrow are the essential documents here, and not
the copious diaries which I hope to publish elsewhere. The first letter
to 'Carreta' is from Edinburgh, where Borrow arrived on Sunday, 19th
September 1858:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, 38 Camperdown Place, Yarmouth, Norfolk</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <i>Sunday (Sept. 19th, 1858).</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I just write a line to inform you that I arrived here
yesterday quite safe. We did not start from Yarmouth till past three
o'clock on Thursday morning; we reached Newcastle about ten on Friday.
As I was walking in the street at Newcastle a sailor-like man came
running up to me, and begged that I would let him speak to me. He
appeared almost wild with joy. I asked him who he was, and he told me he
was a Yarmouth north beach man, and that he knew me very well. Before I
could answer, another sailor-like, short, thick fellow came running up,
who also seemed wild with joy; he was a comrade of the other. I never
saw two people so out of themselves with pleasure, they literally danced
in the street; in fact, they were two of my old friends. I asked them
how they came down there, and they told me that they had been down
fishing. They begged a thousand pardons for speaking to me, but told me
they could not help it. I set off for Alnwick on Friday afternoon,
stayed there all night, and saw the castle next morning. It is a fine
old place, but at present is undergoing repairs&mdash;a Scottish king was
killed before its walls in the old time. At about twelve I started for
Edinburgh. The place is wonderfully altered since I was here, and I
don't think for the better. There is a Runic stone on the castle brae
which I am going to copy. It was not there in my time. If you write
direct to me at the Post Office, Inverness. I am thinking of going to
Glasgow to-morrow, from which place I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> start for Inverness by one
of the packets which go thither by the North-West and the Caledonian
Canal. I hope that you and Hen are well and comfortable. Pray eat plenty
of grapes and partridges. We had upon the whole a pleasant passage from
Yarmouth; we lived plainly but well, and I was not at all ill&mdash;the
captain seemed a kind, honest creature. Remember me kindly to Mrs.
Turnour and Mrs. Clarke, and God bless you and Hen.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>In his unpublished diary Borrow records his journey from Glasgow through
beautiful but over-described scenery to Inverness, where he stayed at
the Caledonian Hotel:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, 38 Camperdown Place, Yarmouth</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Inverness</span>, <i>Sunday (Sept. 26th).</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;This is the third letter which I have written to you.
Whether you have received the other two, or will receive this, I am
doubtful. I have been several times to the post office, but we found no
letter from you, though I expected to find one awaiting me when I
arrived. I wrote last on Friday. I merely want to know once how you are,
and if all is well I shall move onward. It is of not much use staying
here. After I had written to you on Friday I crossed by the ferry over
the Firth and walked to Beauly, and from thence to Beaufort or Castle
Downie; at Beauly I saw the gate of the pit where old Fraser used to put
the people whom he owed money to&mdash;it is in the old ruined cathedral, and
at Beaufort saw the ruins of the house where he was born. Lord Lovat
lives in the house close by. There is now a claimant to the title, a
descendant of old Fraser's elder brother who committed a murder in the
year 1690, and on that account fled to South Wales. The present family
are rather uneasy, and so are their friends, of whom they have a great
number, for though they are flaming Papists they are very free of their
money. I have told several of their cousins that the claimant has not a
chance as the present family have been so long in possession. They
almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> blessed me for saying so. There, however, can be very little
doubt that the title and estate, more than a million acres, belong to
the claimant by strict law. Old Fraser's brother was called Black John
of the Tasser. The man whom he killed was a piper who sang an insulting
song to him at a wedding. I have heard the words and have translated
them; he was dressed very finely, and the piper sang:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'You're dressed in Highland robes, O John,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But ropes of straw would become ye better;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've silver buckles your shoes upon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But leather thongs for them were fitter.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whereupon John drew his dagger and ran it into the piper's
belly; the descendants of the piper are still living at Beauly.
I walked that day thirty-four miles between noon and ten
o'clock at night. My letter of credit is here. This is a dear
place, but not so bad as Edinburgh. <i>If you have written</i>,
don't write any more till you hear from me again. God bless you
and Hen.</p></div>

<p>'Swindled out of a shilling by rascally ferryman,' is Borrow's note in
his diary of the episode that he relates to his wife of crossing the
Firth. He does not tell her, but his diary tells us, that he changed his
inn on the day he wrote this letter: the following jottings from the
diary cover the period:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Sept. 29th.</i>&mdash;Quit the 'Caledonian' for 'Union Sun'&mdash;poor

<p>But to return to Borrow's letters to his wife:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow, 38 Camperdown Terrace, Gt. Yarmouth</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Inverness</span>, <i>September 29th, 1858.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I have got your letter, and glad enough I was
to get it. The day after to-morrow I shall depart from here for
Fort Augustus at some distance up the lake. After staying a few
days there, I am thinking of going to the Isle of Mull, but I
will write to you if possible from Fort Augustus. I am rather
sorry that I came to Scotland&mdash;I was never in such a place in
my life for cheating and imposition, and the farther north you
go the worse things seem to be, and yet I believe it is
possible to live very cheap here, that is if you have a house
of your own and a wife to go out and make bargains, for things
are abundant enough, but if you move about you are at the mercy
of innkeepers and suchlike people. The other day I was swindled
out of a shilling by a villain to whom I had given it for
change. I ought, perhaps, to have had him up before a
magistrate provided I could have found one, but I was in a wild
place and he had a clan about him, and if I had had him up I
have no doubt I should have been outsworn. I, however, have met
one fine, noble old fellow. The other night I lost my way
amongst horrible moors and wandered for miles and miles without
seeing a soul. At last I saw a light which came from the window
of a rude hovel. I tapped at the window and shouted, and at
last an old man came out; he asked me what I wanted, and I told
him I had lost my way. He asked me where I came from and where
I wanted to go, and on my telling him he said I had indeed lost
my way, for I had got out of it at least four miles, and was
going away from the place I wanted to get to. He then said he
would show me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> way, and went with me for several miles over
most horrible places. At last we came to a road where he said
he thought he might leave me, and wished me good-night. I gave
him a shilling. He was very grateful and said, after
considering, that as I had behaved so handsomely to him he
would not leave me yet, as he thought it possible I might yet
lose my way. He then went with me three miles farther, and I
have no doubt that, but for him, I should have lost my way
again, the roads were so tangled. I never saw such an old
fellow, or one whose conversation was so odd and entertaining.
This happened last Monday night, the night of the day in which
I had been swindled of the shilling by the other; I could write
a history about those two shillings.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write another line to tell you that I have got
your second letter&mdash;it came just in time, as I leave to-morrow.
In your next, address to George Borrow, Post Office, Tobermory,
Isle of Mull, Scotland. You had, however, better write without
delay, as I don't know how long I may be there; and be sure
only to write once. I am glad we have got such a desirable
tenant for our Maltings, and should be happy to hear that the
cottage was also let so well. However, let us be grateful for
what has been accomplished. I hope you wrote to Cooke as I
desired you, and likewise said something about how I had waited
for Murray.... I met to-day a very fat gentleman from
Caithness, at the very north of Scotland; he said he was
descended from the Norse. I talked to him about them, and he
was so pleased with my conversation that he gave me his card,
and begged that I would visit him if I went there. As I could
do no less, I showed him my card&mdash;I had but one&mdash;and he no
sooner saw the name than he was in a rapture. I am rather glad
that you have got the next door, as the locality is highly
respectable. Tell Hen that I copied the Runic stone on the
Castle Hill, Edinburgh. It was brought from Denmark in the old
time. The inscription is imperfect, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> I can read enough of
it to see that it was erected by a man to his father and
mother. I again write the direction for your next: George
Borrow, Esq., Post Office, Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland.
God bless you and Hen. Ever yours,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write a line lest you should be uneasy. Before
leaving the Highlands I thought I would see a little more about
me. So last week I set on a four days' task, a walk of a
hundred miles. I returned here late last Thursday night. I
walked that day forty-five miles; during the first twenty the
rain poured in torrents and the wind blew in my face. The last
seventeen miles were in the dark. To-morrow I proceed towards
Mull. I hope that you got my letters, and that I shall find
something from you awaiting me at the post office. The first
day I passed over Corryarrick, a mountain 3000 feet high. I was
nearly up to my middle in snow. As soon as I had passed it I
was in Badenoch. The road on the farther side was horrible, and
I was obliged to wade several rivulets, one of which was very
boisterous and nearly threw me down.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> I wandered through a
wonderful country, and picked up a great many strange legends
from the people I met, but they were very few, the country
being almost a desert, chiefly inhabited by deer. When amidst
the lower mountains I frequently heard them blaring in the
woods above me. The people at the inn here are by far the
nicest I have met; they are kind and honourable to a degree.
God bless you and Hen.</p></div>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;After I wrote to you I walked round Mull and
through it, over Benmore. I likewise went to Icolmkill, and
passed twenty-four hours there. I saw the wonderful ruin and
crossed the island. I suffered a great deal from hunger, but
what I saw amply repaid me; on my return to Tobermory I was
rather unwell, but got better. I was disappointed in a passage
to Thurso by sea, so I was obliged to return to this place by
train.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> On Tuesday,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> D. V., I shall set out on foot, and
hope to find your letter awaiting me at the post office at
Thurso. On coming hither by train I nearly lost my things. I
was told at Huntly that the train stopped ten minutes, and
meanwhile the train drove off <i>purposely</i>; I telegraphed to
Keith in order that my things might be secured, describing
where they were, under the seat. The reply was that there was
nothing of the kind there. I instantly said that I would bring
an action against the company, and walked off to the town,
where I stated the facts to a magistrate, and gave him my name
and address. He advised me to bring my action. I went back and
found the people frightened. They telegraphed again&mdash;and the
reply was that the things were safe. There is nothing like
setting oneself up sometimes. I was terribly afraid I should
never again find my books and things. I, however, got them, and
my old umbrella, too. I was sent on by the mail train, but lost
four hours, besides undergoing a great deal of misery and
excitement. When I have been to Thurso and Kirkwall I shall
return as quick as possible, and shall be glad to get out of
the country. As I am here, however, I wish to see all I can,
for I never wish to return. Whilst in Mull I lived very
cheaply&mdash;it is not costing me more than seven shillings a day.
The generality of the inns, however, in the lowlands are
incredibly dear&mdash;half-a-crown for breakfast, consisting of a
little tea, a couple of small eggs, and bread and butter&mdash;<i>two</i>
shillings for attendance. Tell Hen that I have some moss for
her from Benmore&mdash;also some seaweed from the farther shore of
Icolmkill. God bless you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I reached this place on Friday night, and was
glad enough to get your kind letter. I shall be so glad to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> get
home to you. Since my last letter to you I have walked nearly
160 miles. I was terribly taken in with respect to
distances&mdash;however, I managed to make my way. I have been to
Johnny Groat's House, which is about twenty-two miles from this
place. I had tolerably fine weather all the way, but within two
or three miles of that place a terrible storm arose; the next
day the country was covered with ice and snow. There is at
present here a kind of Greenland winter, colder almost than I
ever knew the winter in Russia. The streets are so covered with
ice that it is dangerous to step out; to-morrow D. and I pass
over into Orkney, and we shall take the first steamer to
Aberdeen and Inverness, from whence I shall make the best of my
way to England. It is well that I have no farther to walk, for
walking now is almost impossible&mdash;the last twenty miles were
terrible, and the weather is worse now than it was then. I was
terribly deceived with respect to steamboats. I was told that
one passed over to Orkney every day, and I have now been
waiting two days, and there is not yet one. I have had quite
enough of Scotland. When I was at Johnny Groat's I got a shell
for dear Hen, which I hope I shall be able to bring or send to
her. I am glad to hear that you have got out the money on
mortgage so satisfactorily. One of the greatest blessings in
this world is to be independent. My spirits of late have been
rather bad, owing principally to my dear mother's death. I
always knew that we should miss her. I dreamt about her at Fort
Augustus. Though I have walked so much I have suffered very
little from fatigue, and have got over the ground with
surprising facility, but I have not enjoyed the country so much
as Wales. I wish that you would order a hat for me against I
come home; the one I am wearing is very shabby, having been so
frequently drenched with rain and storm-beaten. I cannot say
the exact day that I shall be home, but you may be expecting
me. The worst is that there is no depending on the steamers,
for there is scarcely any traffic in Scotland in winter. My
appetite of late has been very poorly, chiefly, I believe,
owing to badness of food and want of regular meals. Glad
enough, I repeat, shall I be to get home to you and Hen.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Kirkwall, Orkney, <i>November 27th, 1858. Saturday.</i></span><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I am, as you see, in Orkney, and I expect every
minute the steamer which will take me to Shetland and Aberdeen,
from which last place I go by train to Inverness, where my
things are, and thence home. I had a stormy passage to
Stromness, from whence I took a boat to the Isle of Hoy, where
I saw the wonderful Dwarf's House hollowed out of the stone.
From Stromness I walked here. I have seen the old Norwegian
Cathedral; it is of red sandstone, and looks as if cut out of
rock. It is different from almost everything of the kind I ever
saw. It is stern and grand to a degree. I have also seen the
ruins of the old Norwegian Bishop's palace in which King Hacon
died; also the ruins of the palace of Patrick, Earl of Orkney.
I have been treated here with every kindness and civility. As
soon as the people knew who I was they could scarcely make
enough of me. The Sheriff, Mr. Robertson, a great Gaelic
scholar, said he was proud to see me in his house; and a young
gentleman of the name of Petrie, Clerk of Supply, has done
nothing but go about with me to show me the wonders of the
place. Mr. Robertson wished to give me letters to some
gentleman at Edinburgh. I, however, begged leave to be excused,
saying that I wished to get home, as, indeed, I do, for my mind
is wearied by seeing so many strange places. On my way to
Kirkwall I saw the stones of Stennis&mdash;immense blocks of stone
standing up like those of Salisbury Plain. All the country is
full of Druidical and Pictish remains. It is, however, very
barren, and scarcely a tree is to be seen, only a few dwarf
ones. Orkney consists of a multitude of small islands, the
principal of which is Pomona, in which Kirkwall is. The
currents between them are terrible. I hope to be home a few
days after you receive these lines, either by rail or steamer.
This is a fine day, but there has been dreadful weather here. I
hope we shall have a prosperous passage. I have purchased a
little Kirkwall newspaper, which I send you with this letter. I
shall perhaps post both at Lerwick or Aberdeen. I sent you a
Johnny Groat's newspaper, which I hope you got. Don't tear
either up, for they are curious. God bless you and Hen.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write a line to tell you that I am well and
that I am on my way to England, but I am stopped here for a
day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> for there is no conveyance. Wherever I can walk I get on
very well&mdash;but if you depend on coaches or any means of
conveyance in this country you are sure to be disappointed.
This place is but thirty-five miles from Edinburgh, yet I am
detained for a day&mdash;there is no train. The waste of that day
will prevent me getting to Yarmouth from Hull by the steamer.
Were it not for my baggage I would walk to Edinburgh. I got to
Aberdeen, where I posted a letter for you. I was then obliged
to return to Inverness for my luggage&mdash;125 miles. Rather than
return again to Aberdeen, I sent on my things to Dunkeld and
walked the 102 miles through the Highlands. When I got here I
walked to Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, thirty-eight miles over
horrible roads. I then got back here. I have now seen the whole
of Scotland that is worth seeing, and have walked 600 miles. I
shall be glad to be out of the country; a person here must
depend entirely upon himself and his own legs. I have not spent
much money&mdash;my expenses during my wanderings averaged a
shilling a day. As I was walking through Strathspey, singularly
enough I met two or three of the Phillips. I did not know them,
but a child came running after me to ask me my name. It was
Miss P. and two of the children. I hope to get to you in two or
three days after you get this. God bless you and dear Hen.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>In spite of Borrow's vow never to visit Scotland again, he was there
eight years later&mdash;in 1866&mdash;but only in the lowlands. His stepdaughter,
Hen., or Henrietta Clarke, had married Dr. MacOubrey, of Belfast, and
Borrow and his wife went on a visit to the pair. But the incorrigible
vagabond in Borrow was forced to declare itself, and leaving his wife
and daughter in Belfast he crossed to Stranraer by steamer on 17th July
1866, and tramped through the lowlands, visiting Ecclefechan and Gretna
Green. We have no record of his experiences at these places. The only
literary impression of the Scots tour of 1866, apart from a brief
reference in Dr. Knapp's <i>Life</i>, is an essay on Kirk Yetholm in <i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i>. We would gladly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> have exchanged it for an account of his
visits to Abbotsford and Melrose, two places which he saw in August of
this year.</p>

<p>In his letter of 27th November from Kirkwall it will be seen that Borrow
records the kindness received from 'a young gentleman of the name of
Petrie.' It is pleasant to find that when he returned to England he did
not forget that kindness, as the next letter demonstrates:</p>


<h3>To George Petrie, Esq., Kirkwall</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">39 <span class="smcap">Camperdown Place, Yarmouth</span>, <i>Jany. 14, 1859.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Some weeks ago I wrote to Mr. Murray (and)
requested him to transmit to you two works of mine. Should you
not have received them by the time this note reaches you, pray
inform me and I will write to him again. They may have come
already, but whenever they may come to hand, keep them in
remembrance of one who will never forget your kind attention to
him in Orkney.</p>

<p>On reaching Aberdeen I went to Inverness by rail. From there I
sent off my luggage to Dunkeld, and walked thither by the
Highland road. I never enjoyed a walk more&mdash;the weather was
tolerably fine, and I was amidst some of the finest scenery in
the world. I was particularly struck with that of Glen Truim.
Near the top of the valley in sight of the Craig of Badenoch on
the left hand side of the way, I saw an immense cairn, probably
the memorial of some bloody clan battle. On my journey I picked
up from the mouth of an old Highland woman a most remarkable
tale concerning the death of Fian or Fingal. It differs
entirely from the Irish legends which I have heard on the
subject&mdash;and is of a truly mythic character. Since visiting
Shetland I have thought a great deal about the Picts, but
cannot come to any satisfactory conclusion. Were they Celts?
were they Laps? Macbeth could hardly have been a Lap, but then
the tradition of the country that they were a diminutive race,
and their name Pight or Pict, which I almost think is the same
as petit&mdash;pixolo&mdash;puj&mdash;pigmy. It is a truly perplexing
subject&mdash;quite as much so as that of Fingal, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> whether he
was a Scotsman or an Irishman I have never been able to decide,
as there has been so much to be said on both sides of the
question. Please present my kind remembrances to Mrs. Petrie
and all friends, particularly Mr. Sheriff Robertson,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> who
first did me the favour of making me acquainted with you.&mdash;And
believe me to remain, dear Sir, ever sincerely yours,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thank you for the newspaper&mdash;the notice was very kind, but
rather too flattering.</p></div>

<p>On the same day that Borrow wrote, Mr. Petrie sent his acknowledgment of
the books, and so the letters crossed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was very agreeably surprised on opening a packet, which came
to me per steamer ten days ago, to find that it contained a
present from you of your highly interesting and valuable works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
<i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i>. Coming from any person such books
would have been highly prized by me, and it is therefore
specially gratifying to have them presented to me by their
author. Please to accept of my sincere and heartfelt thanks for
your kind remembrance of me and your valuable gift. May I
request you to confer an additional favour on me by sending me
a slip of paper to be pasted on each of the five volumes,
stating that they were presented to me by you. I would like to
hand them down as an heirloom to my family. I am afraid you
will think that I am a very troublesome acquaintance.</p>

<p>I would have written sooner, but I expected to have had some
information to give you about some of the existing
superstitions of Orkney which might perhaps have some interest
for you. I have, however, been much engrossed with county
business during the last fortnight, and must therefore reserve
my account of these matters till another opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour, our principal landowner in Orkney, is just now
writing an article on the ancient laws and customs of the
county to be prefixed to a miscellaneous collection of
documents, chiefly of the sixteenth century. He is taking the
opportunity to give an account of the nature of the tenures by
which the ancient Jarls held the Jarldom, and the manner in
which the odalret became gradually supplanted. I have furnished
him with several of the documents, and am just now going over
it with him. It is for the Bannatyne Club in Edinburgh that he
is preparing it, but I have suggested to him to have it printed
for general sale, as it is very interesting, and contains a
great mass of curious information condensed into a
comparatively small space. Mr. Balfour is very sorry that he
had not the pleasure of meeting you when you were here.</p></div>

<p>My last glimpse of George Borrow in Scotland during his memorable trip
of the winter of 1858 is contained in a letter that I received some time
ago from the Rev. J. Wilcock of St. Ringan's Manse, Lerwick, which runs
as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Nov. 18th, 1903.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As I see that you are interested in George Borrow,
would you allow me to supply you with a little notice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> him
which has not appeared in print? A friend here&mdash;need I explain
that this is written from the capital of the Shetlands?&mdash;a
friend, I say, now dead, told me that one day early in the
forenoon, during the winter, he had walked out from the town
for a stroll into the country. About a mile out from the town
is a piece of water called the Loch of Clickimin, on a
peninsula, in which is an ancient (so-called) 'Pictish Castle.'
His attention was attracted by a tall, burly stranger, who was
surveying this ancient relic with deep interest. As the water
of the loch was well up about the castle, converting the plot
of ground on which it stood almost altogether into an island,
the stranger took off shoes and stockings and trousers, and
waded all round the building in order to get a thorough view of
it. This procedure was all the more remarkable from the fact,
as above mentioned, that the season was winter. I believe that
there was snow on the ground at the time. My friend noticed on
meeting him again in the course of the same walk that he was
very lightly clothed. He had on a cotton shirt, a loose open
jacket, and on the whole was evidently indifferent to the
rigour of our northern climate at that time of the year.</p></div>

<p>In addition to the visit to Belfast in 1866, Borrow was in Ireland the
year following his Scots tour of 1858, that is to say from July to
November 1859. He went, accompanied by his wife and daughter, by
Holyhead to Dublin, where, as Dr. Knapp has discovered, they resided at
75 St. Stephen Green, South. Borrow, as was his custom, left his family
while he was on a walking tour which included Connemara and on northward
to the Giant's Causeway. He was keenly interested in the two Societies
in Dublin engaged upon the study of ancient Irish literature, and he
became a member of the Ossianic Society in July of this year. I have a
number of Borrow's translations from the Irish in my possession, but no
notebooks of his tour on this occasion.</p>

<p>All Irishmen who wish their country to preserve its individuality should
have a kindly feeling for George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> Borrow. Opposed as he was to the
majority of the people in religion and in politics, he was about the
only Englishman of his time who took an interest in their national
literature, language and folk-lore. Had he written such another travel
book about Ireland as he wrote about Wales he would certainly have added
to the sum of human pleasure.</p>

<p>I find only one letter to his wife during this Irish journey:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Carreta</span>,&mdash;I write to you a few lines. I have now walked
270 miles, and have passed through Leinster and Connaught. I
have suffered a good deal of hardship, for this is a very
different country to walk in from England. The food is bad and
does not agree with me. I shall be glad to get back, but first
of all I wish to walk to the Causeway. As soon as I have done
that I shall get on railroad and return, as I find there is a
railroad from Londonderry to Dublin. Pray direct to me at Post
Office, Londonderry. I have at present about seven pounds
remaining, perhaps it would bring me back to Dublin; however,
to prevent accidents, have the kindness to enclose me an order
on the Post Office, Londonderry, for five pounds. I expect to
be there next Monday, and to be home by the end of the week.
Glad enough I shall be to get back to you and Hen. I got your
letter at Galway. What you said about poor Flora was
comforting&mdash;pray take care of her. Don't forget the order. I
hope to write in a day or two a kind of duplicate of this. I
send Hen. heath from Connemara, and also seaweed from a bay of
the Atlantic. I have walked across Ireland; the country people
are civil; but I believe all classes are disposed to join the
French. The idolatry and popery are beyond conception. God
bless you, dearest.</p></div>

</p><p>
'<i>Friday, 26th November, 1858.</i>&mdash;In the evening Geo. Petrie called with
"Bible Borrow." He is a man about 60, upwards of six feet in height, and
of an athletic though somewhat gaunt frame. His hair is pure white
though a little bit thin on the top, his features high and handsome, and
his complexion ruddy and healthy. He was dressed in black, his surtout
was old, his shoes very muddy. He spoke in a loud tone of voice, knows
Gaelic and Irish well, quoted Ian Lom, Duncan Ban M'Intyre, etc., is
publishing an account of Welsh, Irish, and Gaelic bards. He
travelled&mdash;on foot principally&mdash;from Inverness to Thurso, and is going
on to-morrow to Zetland. He walked lately through the upper part of
Badenoch, Lochaber, and the adjacent counties, and through Mull, which
he greatly admired.... In his rambles he associated exclusively with the
lower classes, and when I offered to give him letters of introduction to
Wm. F. Skene, Robert Chambers, Joseph Robertson, etc., he declined to
accept them. His mother died lately and he was travelling, he said, to
divert and throw off his melancholy. He talked very freely on all
subjects that one broached, but not with precision, and he appeared to
me to be an amiable man and a gentleman, but, withal, something of a
projector, if not an adventurer. He is certainly eccentric. I asked him
to take wine, etc., and he declined. He said he was bred at the High
School of Edinburgh, and that he was there in 1813, and mentioned that
he was partly educated in Ireland, and that by birth and descent he is
an Englishman.'</p></div>

<h3><i>THE ROMANY RYE</i></h3>


<p>George Borrow's three most important books had all a very interesting
history. We have seen the processes by which <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was
built up from notebooks and letters. We have seen further the most
curious apprenticeship by which <i>Lavengro</i> came into existence. The most
distinctly English book&mdash;at least in a certain absence of
cosmopolitanism&mdash;that Victorian literature produced was to a great
extent written on scraps of paper during a prolonged Continental tour
which included Constantinople and Budapest. In <i>Lavengro</i> we have only
half a book, the whole work, which included what came to be published as
<i>The Romany Rye</i>, having been intended to appear in four volumes. The
first volume was written in 1843, the second in 1845, after the
Continental tour, which is made use of in the description of the
Hungarian, and the third volume in the years between 1845 and 1848. Then
in 1852 Borrow wrote out an 'advertisement' of a fourth volume,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
which runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Shortly will be published in one volume. Price 10s. <i>The
Rommany Rye</i>, Being the fourth volume of <i>Lavengro</i>. By George
Borrow, author of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>But this volume did not make an appearance 'shortly.' Its author was far
too much offended with the critics, too disheartened it may be to care
to offer himself again for their gibes. The years rolled on, much of the
time being spent at Yarmouth, a little of it at Oulton. There was a
visit to Cornwall in 1854, and another to Wales in the same year. The
Isle of Man was selected for a holiday in 1855, and not until 1857 did
<i>The Romany Rye</i> appear. The book was now in two volumes, and we see
that the word Romany had dropped an 'm':</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Romany Rye: A Sequel to 'Lavengro.' By George Borrow,
author of 'The Bible in Spain,' 'The Gypsies of Spain,' etc.,
'Fear God, and take your own part.' In Two Volumes. London:
John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1857.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Knapp publishes some vigorous correspondence between Mrs. Borrow and
her husband's publisher written prior to the issue of <i>The Romany Rye</i>.
'Mr. Borrow has not the slightest wish to publish the book,' she says.
'The manuscript was left with you because you wished to see it.'<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
This was written in 1855, the wife presumably writing at her husband's
dictation. In 1857 the situation was not improved, as Borrow himself
writes to Mr. Murray: 'In your last letter you talk of <i>obliging me by
publishing my verse</i>. Now is not that speaking very injudiciously?'<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
At last, however, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> April 1857, <i>The Romany Rye</i> appeared, and we are
introduced once more to many old favourites, to Petulengro, to the Man
in Black, and above all to Isopel Berners. The incidents of <i>Lavengro</i>
are supposed to have taken place between the 24th May 1825 and the 18th
July of that year. In <i>The Romany Rye</i> the incidents apparently occur
between 19th July and 3rd August 1825. In the opinion of that most
eminent of gypsy experts, Mr. John Sampson,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> the whole of the
episodes in the five volumes occurred in seventy-two days. Mr. Sampson
agrees with Dr. Knapp in locating Mumper's Dingle in Momber or Monmer
Lane, Willenhall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> Shropshire. The dingle has disappeared&mdash;it is now
occupied by the Monmer Lane Ironworks&mdash;but you may still find Dingle
Bridge and Dingle Lane. The book has added to the glamour of gypsydom,
and to the interest in the gypsies which we all derive from <i>Lavengro</i>,
but Mr. Sampson makes short work of Borrow's gypsy learning on its
philological side. 'No gypsy,' he says, 'ever uses <i>chal</i> or <i>engro</i> as
a separate word, or talks of the <i>dukkering dook</i> or of <i>penning a
dukkerin</i>.' 'Borrow's genders are perversely incorrect'; and 'Romany'&mdash;a
word which can never get out of our language, let philologists say what
they will&mdash;should have been 'Romani.' '"Haarstr&auml;ubend" is the fitting
epithet,' says Mr. Sampson, 'which an Oriental scholar, Professor
Richard Pischel of Berlin, finds to describe Borrow's etymologies.' But
all this is very unimportant, and the book remains in the whole of its
forty-seven chapters not one whit less a joy to us than does its
predecessor <i>Lavengro</i>, with its visions of gypsies and highwaymen and
boxers.</p>

<p>But then there is its 'Appendix.' That appendix of eleven petulant
chapters undoubtedly did Borrow harm in his day and generation. Now his
fame is too great, and his genius too firmly established for these
strange dissertations on men and things to offer anything but amusement
or edification. They reveal, for example, the singularly non-literary
character of this great man of letters. Much&mdash;too much&mdash;has been made of
his dislike of Walter Scott and his writings. As a matter of fact Borrow
tells us that he admired Scott both as a prose writer and as a poet.
'Since Scott he had read no modern writer. Scott was greater than
Homer,' he told Frances Cobbe. But he takes occasion to condemn his
'Charlie o'er the water nonsense,' and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> declares that his love of and
sympathy with certain periods and incidents have made for sympathy with
what he always calls 'Popery.'<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Well, looking at the matter from an
entirely opposite point of view, Cardinal Newman declared that the
writings of Scott had had no inconsiderable influence in directing his
mind towards the Church of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During the first quarter of this century a great poet was
raised up in the North, who, whatever were his defects, has
contributed by his works, in prose and verse, to prepare men
for some closer and more practical approximation to Catholic
truth. The general need of something deeper and more attractive
than what had offered itself elsewhere may be considered to
have led to his popularity; and by means of his popularity he
re-acted on his readers, stimulating their mental thirst,
feeding their hopes, setting before them visions, which, when
once seen, are not easily forgotten, and silently
indoctrinating them with nobler ideas, which might afterwards
be appealed to as first principles.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>And thus we see that Borrow had a certain prescience in this matter. But
Borrow, in good truth, cared little for modern English literature. His
heart was entirely with the poets of other lands&mdash;the Scandinavians and
the Kelts. In Virgil he apparently took little interest, nor in the
great poetry of Greece, Rome and England, although we find a reference
to Theocritus and Dante in his books. Fortunately for his fame he had
read <i>Gil Blas</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i>, and, above all, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, which
last book, first read as a boy of six, coloured his whole life. Defoe
and Fielding and Bunyan were the English authors to whom he owed most.
Of Byron he has quaint things to say, and of Wordsworth things that are
neither quaint nor wise. We recall the man in the field in the
twenty-second chapter of <i>The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> Romany Rye</i> who used Wordsworth's poetry
as a soporific. And throughout his life Borrow's position towards his
contemporaries in literature was ever contemptuous. He makes no mention
of Carlyle or Ruskin or Matthew Arnold, and they in their turn, it may
be added, make no mention of him or of his works. Thackeray he snubbed
on one of the few occasions they met, and Browning and Tennyson were
alike unrevealed to him. Borrow indeed stands quite apart from the great
literature of a period in which he was a striking and individual figure.
Lacking appreciation in this sphere of work, he wrote of 'the
contemptible trade of author,' counting it less creditable than that of
a jockey.</p>

<p>But all this is a digression from the progress of our narrative of the
advent of <i>The Romany Rye</i>. The book was published in an edition of 1000
copies in April 1857, and it took thirty years to dispose of 3750
copies. Not more than 2000 copies of his book were sold in Great Britain
during the twenty-three remaining years of Borrow's life. What wonder
that he was embittered by his failure! The reviews were far from
favourable, although Mr. Elwin wrote not unkindly in an article in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> called 'Roving Life in England.' No critic, however,
was as severe as <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, which had called <i>Lavengro</i>
'balderdash' and referred to <i>The Romany Rye</i> as the 'literary dough' of
an author 'whose dullest gypsy preparation we have now read.' In later
years, when, alas! it was too late, <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, through the eloquent
pen of Theodore Watts, made good amends. But William Bodham Donne wrote
to Borrow with adequate enthusiasm:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

write to you before I was able to read it, at least once, since
it is needless, I hope, for me to assure you that I am truly
gratified by the gift.</p>

<p>Time to read it I could not find for some days after it was
sent hither, for what with winding up my affairs here, the
election of my successor, preparations for flitting, etc.,
etc., I have been incessantly occupied with matters needful to
be done, but far less agreeable to do than reading <i>The Romany
Rye</i>. All I have said of <i>Lavengro</i> to yourself personally, or
to others publicly or privately, I say again of <i>The Romany
Rye</i>. Everywhere in it the hand of the master is stamped boldly
and deeply. You join the chisel of Dante with the pencil of
Defoe.</p>

<p>I am rejoiced to see so many works announced of yours, for you
have more that is worth knowing to tell than any one I am
acquainted with. For your coming progeny's sake I am disposed
to wish you had worried the literary-craft less. Brand and
score them never so much, they will not turn and repent, but
only spit the more froth and venom. I am reckoning of my
emancipation with an eagerness hardly proper at my years, but I
cannot help it, so thoroughly do I hate London, and so much do
I love the country. I have taken a house, or rather a cottage,
at Walton on Thames, just on the skirts of Weybridge, and there
I hope to see you before I come into Norfolk, for I am afraid
my face will not be turned eastward for many weeks if not
months.</p>

<p>Remember me kindly to Mrs. Borrow and Miss Clarke, and believe
me, my dear Sir, very truly and thankfully yours.</p></div>

court composed of 13 of the poor old freemen who attend the

'Slovens Hall.' Reading <i>Romany Rye</i> I notice your account of

enquire whether you think that the Sclaves might be connected

<p>In spite of contemporary criticism, <i>The Romany Rye</i> is a great book, or
rather it contains the concluding chapters of a great book. Sequels are
usually proclaimed to be inferior to their predecessors. But <i>The Romany
Rye</i> is not a sequel. It is part of <i>Lavengro</i>, and is therefore
Borrow's most imperishable monument.</p>

was John Murray <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, who died in 1843. John Murray <span class="smcap">iii.</span>, who died in

had differences at times, but he was loyal to them and they were loyal
to him as good authors and good publishers ought to be. With all his
irritability Borrow had the sense to see that there was substantial
reason in their declining to issue his translations. That, although at
the end there were long intervals of silence, the publishers and their
author remained friends is shown by letters written to his daughter
after Borrow's death, and by the following little note from Borrow to
John Murray which was probably never sent. It is in the feeble, broken

<h3>EDWARD FITZGERALD</h3>


<p>Edward FitzGerald once declared that he was about the only friend with
whom Borrow had never quarrelled.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> There was probably no reason for
this exceptional amity other than the 'genius for friendship' with which
FitzGerald has been rightly credited. There were certainly, however,
many points of likeness between the two men which might have kept them
at peace. Both had written copiously and out of all proportion to the
public demand for their work. Both revelled in translation. FitzGerald's
eight volumes in a magnificent American edition consists mainly of
translations from various tongues which no man presumably now reads. All
the world has read and will long continue to read his translation or
paraphrase of Omar Khayy&aacute;m's <i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i>. 'Old Fitz,' as his friends
called him, lives by that, although his letters are among the best in
literature. Borrow wrote four books that will live, but had publishers
been amenable he would have published forty, and all as unsaleable as
the major part of FitzGerald's translations. Both men were Suffolk
squires, and yet delighted more in the company of a class other than
their own, FitzGerald of boatmen, Borrow of gypsies; both were counted
eccentrics in their respective villages. Perhaps alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> among the great
Victorian authors they lived to be old without receiving in their lives
any popular recognition of their great literary achievements. But
FitzGerald had a more cultivated mind than Borrow. He loved literature
and literary men whilst Borrow did not. His criticism of books is of the
best, and his friendships with bookmen are among the most interesting in
literary history. 'A solitary, shy, kind-hearted man,' was the verdict
upon him of the frequently censorious Carlyle. When Anne Thackeray asked
her father which of his friends he had loved best, he answered 'Dear old
Fitz, to be sure,' and Tennyson would have said the same. Borrow had
none of these gifts as a letter-writer and no genius for friendship. The
charm of his style, so indisputable in his best work, is absent from his
letters; and his friends were alienated one after another. Borrow's
undisciplined intellect and narrow upbringing were a curse to him, from
the point of view of his own personal happiness, although they helped
him to achieve exactly the work for which he was best fitted. Borrow's
acquaintance with FitzGerald was commenced by the latter, who, in July
1853, sent from Boulge Hall, Suffolk, to Oulton Hall, in the same
county, his recently published volume <i>Six Dramas of Calderon</i>. He
apologises for making so free with 'a great man; but, as usual, I shall
feel least fear before a man like yourself who both do fine things in
your own language and are deep read in those of others.' He also refers
to 'our common friend Donne,' so that it is probable that they had met
at Donne's house.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The next letter, also published by Dr. Knapp,
that FitzGerald writes to Borrow is dated from his home in Great
Portland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> Street in 1856. He presents his friend with a Turkish
Dictionary, and announces his coming marriage to Miss Barton, 'Our
united ages amount to 96!&mdash;a dangerous experiment on both sides'&mdash;as it
proved. The first reference to Borrow in the FitzGerald <i>Letters</i> issued
by his authorised publishers is addressed to Professor Cowell in January
1857:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was with Borrow a week ago at Donne's, and also at Yarmouth
three months ago: he is well, but not yet agreed with Murray.
He read me a long translation he had made from the Turkish:
which I could not admire, and his taste becomes stranger than
ever.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p></div>

<p>But Borrow's genius if not his taste was always admired by FitzGerald,
as the following letter among my Borrow Papers clearly indicates. Borrow
had published <i>The Romany Rye</i> at the beginning of May:</p>

<p>In a letter to Cowell about the same time&mdash;June 5, 1857&mdash;FitzGerald
writes that he is about to set out for Gorleston, Great Yarmouth:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Within hail almost lives George Borrow, who has lately
published, and given me, two new volumes of Lavengro called
<i>Romany Rye</i>, with some excellent things, and some very bad (as
I have made bold to write to him&mdash;how shall I face him!) You
would not like the book at all I think.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p></div>

<p>It was Cowell, it will be remembered, who introduced FitzGerald to the
Persian poet Omar, and afterwards regretted the act. The first edition
of <i>The Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i> appeared two years later, in 1859.
Edward Byles Cowell was born in Ipswich in 1826, and he was educated at
the Ipswich Grammar School. It was in the library attached to the
Ipswich Library Institution that Cowell commenced the study of Oriental
languages. In 1842 he entered the business of his father and grandfather
as a merchant and maltster. When only twenty years of age he commenced
his friendship with Edward FitzGerald, and their correspondence may be
found in Dr. Aldis Wright's <i>FitzGerald Correspondence</i>. In 1850 he left
his brother to carry on the business and entered himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> at Magdalen
Hall, Oxford, where he passed six years. At intervals he read Greek with
FitzGerald and, later, Persian. FitzGerald commenced to learn this last
language, which was to bring him fame, when he was forty-four years of
age. In 1856 Cowell was appointed to a Professorship of English History
at Calcutta, and from there he sent FitzGerald a copy of the manuscript
of <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, afterwards lent by FitzGerald to Borrow. Much earlier
than this&mdash;in 1853&mdash;FitzGerald had written to Borrow:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At Ipswich, indeed, is a man whom you would like to know, I
think, and who would like to know you; one Edward Cowell: a
great scholar, if I may judge.... Should you go to Ipswich do
look for him! a great deal more worth looking for (I speak with
no sham modesty, I am sure) than yours,&mdash;E. F. G.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p></div>

<p>Twenty-six years afterwards&mdash;in 1879&mdash;we find FitzGerald writing to Dr.
Aldis Wright to the effect that Cowell had been seized with 'a wish to
learn Welsh under George Borrow':</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And as he would not venture otherwise, I gave him a Note of
Introduction, and off he went, and had an hour with the old
Boy, who was hard of hearing and shut up in a stuffy room, but
cordial enough; and Cowell was glad to have seen the Man, and
tell him that it was his <i>Wild Wales</i> which first inspired a
thirst for this language into the Professor.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p></div>

<p>This introduction and meeting are described by Professor Cowell in the
following letter:<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I fear I cannot help you much by my reminiscences
of Borrow. I never had the slightest interest in the gipsies,
but I always had a corner in my heart for Spain and Wales, and
consequently <i>The Bible in Spain</i> and <i>Wild Wales</i> have always
been favourite books. But though Borrow's works were well known
to me, I never saw him but once, and what I saw of him then
made me feel that he was one of those men who put the best part
of themselves into their books. We get the pure gold there
without the admixture of alloy which daily life seemed to
impart.</p>

<p>I was staying one autumn at Lowestoft some ten years or more
ago when I asked my dear old friend, Mr. Edward FitzGerald, to
give me a letter of introduction to Mr. George Borrow. Armed
with this I started on my pilgrimage and took a chaise for
Oulton Hall. I remember as we drew near we turned into a kind
of drift road through the fields where the long sweeping boughs
of the trees hung so low that I lost my hat more than once as
we drove along. My driver remarked that the old gentleman would
not allow any of his trees to be cut. When we reached the hall
I went in at the gate into the farmyard, but I could see nobody
about anywhere. I walked up to the front door, but nobody
answered my knock except some dogs, who began barking from
their kennels. At last in answer to a very loud knock, the door
was opened by an old gentleman whom I at once recognised by the
engraving to be Borrow himself. I gave him my letter and
introduced myself. He replied in a tone of humorous petulance,
'What is the good of your bringing me a letter when I haven't
got my spectacles to read it?' However, he took me into his
room, where I fancy my knock had roused him from a siesta. We
soon got into talk. He began by some unkind remarks about one
or two of our common friends, but I soon turned the subject to
books, especially Spanish and Welsh books. Here I own I was
disappointed in his conversation. I talked to him about Ab
Gwilym, whom he speaks so highly of in <i>Wild Wales</i>, but his
interest was languid. He did not seem interested when I told
him that the London Society of Cymmrodorion were publishing in
their journal the Welsh poems of Iolo Goch, the bard of Owen
Glendower who fought with our Henry v., two of whose poems
Borrow had given spirited translations of in <i>Wild Wales</i>. He
told me he had heaps of translations from Welsh books somewhere
in his cupboards but he did not know where to lay his hand on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
them. He did not show me one Welsh or Spanish book of any kind.
You may easily imagine that I was disappointed with my
interview and I never cared to visit him again. Borrow was a
man of real genius, and his <i>Bible in Spain</i> and <i>Wild Wales</i>
are unique books in their way, but with all his knowledge of
languages he was not a scholar. I should be the last person to
depreciate his <i>Sleeping Bard</i>, for I owe a great deal to it as
it helped me to read the Welsh original, but it is full of
careless mistakes. The very title is wrong; it should not be
the <i>Visions of the Sleeping Bard</i> but the <i>Visions of the Bard
Sleep</i>, as the bard or prophet Sleep shows the author in a
series of dreams&mdash;his visions of life, death, and hell, which
form the three chapters of the book.</p>

<p>Borrow knew nothing of philology. His strange version of 'Om
mani padme h&ucirc;m' (Oh! the gem in the lotus ho!) must have been
taken from some phonetic representation of the sounds as heard
by an ignorant traveller in China or Mongolia.</p>

<p>I have written this long letter lured on by my recollections,
but after all I can tell you nothing. Surely it is best that
Borrow should remain a name; we have the best part of him still
living in his best books.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He gave the people of his best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His worst he kept, his best he gave.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I don't see why we should trouble ourselves about his 'worst.'
He had his weaker side like all of us, the foolish part of his
nature as well as the wise; but 'de mortuis nil nisi bonum'
especially applies in such cases.&mdash;I remain, dear sir, yours
sincerely,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">E. B. Cowell.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>There is one short letter from FitzGerald to Borrow in Dr. Aldis
Wright's <i>FitzGerald Letters</i>. It is dated June 1857 and from it we
learn that FitzGerald lent Borrow the Calcutta manuscript of <i>Omar
Khayy&aacute;m</i>, upon which he based his own immortal translation, and from a
letter to W. H. Thompson in 1861 we learn that Cowell, who had inspired
the writing of FitzGerald's <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, Donne and Borrow were the
only three friends to whom he had sent copies of his 'peccadilloes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> in
verse' as he calls his remarkable translation,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and this two years
after it was published. A letter, dated July 6, 1857,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> asks for the
return of FitzGerald's copy of the Ouseley manuscript of <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>,
Borrow having clearly already returned the Calcutta manuscript. This
letter concludes on a pathetic note:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My old Parson Crabbe is bowing down under epileptic fits, or
something like, and I believe his brave old white head will
soon sink into the village church sward. Why, <i>our</i> time seems
coming. Make way, gentlemen!</p></div>

<p>Borrow comes more than once into the story of FitzGerald's great
translation of <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, which in our day has caused so great a
sensation, and deserves all the enthusiasm that it has excited as the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">' ... golden Eastern lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than which I know no version done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In English more divinely well,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to quote Tennyson's famous eulogy. Cowell, to his after regret, for he
had none of FitzGerald's <i>dolce far niente</i> paganism, had sent
FitzGerald from Calcutta, where he was, the manuscript of Omar Khayy&aacute;m's
<i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i> in Persian, and FitzGerald was captured by it. Two years
later, as we know, he produced the translation, which was so much more
than a translation. 'Omar breathes a sort of consolation to me,' he
wrote to Cowell. 'Borrow is greatly delighted with your MS. of Omar
which I showed him,' he says in another letter to Cowell (June 23,
1857), 'delighted at the terseness so unusual in Oriental verse.'<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to George Crabbe the third, and the grandson of the poet, in
1862, FitzGerald tells him that he has just been reading Borrow's <i>Wild
Wales</i>, 'which <i>I</i> like well because I can hear him talking it. But I
don't know if others will like it.' 'No one writes better English than
Borrow in general,' he says. But FitzGerald, as a lover of style, is
vexed with some of Borrow's phrases, and instances one: '"The scenery
was beautiful <i>to a degree</i>," <i>What</i> degree? When did this vile phrase
arise?' The criticism is just, but Borrow, in common with many other
great English authors whose work will live was not uniformly a good
stylist. He has many lamentable fallings away from the ideals of the
stylist. But he will, by virtue of a wonderful individuality, outlive
many a good stylist. His four great books are immortal, and one of them
is <i>Wild Wales</i>.</p>

<p>We have a glimpse of FitzGerald in the following letter in my
possession, by the friend who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> introduced him to Borrow, William
Bodham Donne:<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

copy arrived I had obtained one from the London Library and
read it through, not exactly <i>stans pede in uno</i>, but certainly
almost at a stretch. I could not indeed lay it down, it
interested me so much. It is one of the very best records of
home travel, if indeed so strange a country as Wales is can
properly be called <i>home</i>, I have ever met with.</p>

<p>Immediately on closing the third volume I secured a few pages
in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for <i>Wild Wales</i>, for though you do not
stand in need of my aid, yet my notice will not do you a
mischief, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> some of the reviewers of <i>Lavengro</i> were, I
recollect, shocking blockheads, misinterpreting the letter and
misconceiving the spirit of that work. I have, since we met in
Burlington Arcade, been on a visit to FitzGerald. He is in
better spirits by far than when I saw him about the same time
in last year. He has his pictures and his chattels about him,
and has picked up some acquaintance among the merchants and
mariners of Woodbridge, who, although far below his level, are
yet better company than the two old skippers he was consorting
with in 1861. They&mdash;his present friends&mdash;came in of an evening,
and sat and drank and talked, and I enjoyed their talk very
much, since they discussed of what they understood, which is
more than I can say generally of the fine folks I occasionally
(very occasionally now) meet in London. I should have said more
about your book, only I wish to keep it for print: and you
don't need to be told by me that it is very good.&mdash;With best
regards to Mrs. Borrow and Miss Clarke, I am, yours ever truly,</p></div>

<p>The last letter from FitzGerald to Borrow is dated many years after the
correspondence I have here printed,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and from it we gather that
there had been no correspondence in the interval.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> FitzGerald writes
from Little Grange, Woodbridge, in January 1875, to say that he had
received a message from Borrow that he would be glad to see him at
Oulton. 'I think the more of it,' says FitzGerald, 'because I imagine,
from what I have heard, that you have slunk away from human company as
much as I have.' He hints that they might not like one another so well
after a fifteen years' separation. He declares with infinite pathos that
he has now severed himself from all old ties, has refused the
invitations of old college friends and old schoolfellows. To him there
was no companionship possible for his declining days other than his
reflections and verses. It is a fine letter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> filled with that
graciousness of spirit that was ever a trait in FitzGerald's noble
nature. The two men never met again. When Borrow died, in 1881,
FitzGerald, who followed him two years later, suggested to Dr. Aldis
Wright, afterwards to be his (FitzGerald's) executor, who was staying
with him at the time, that he should look over Borrow's books and
manuscripts if his stepdaughter so desired. If this had been arranged,
and Dr. Aldis Wright had written Borrow's life, there would have been no
second biographer.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

Bodham Donne and his Friends</i>, edited by Catharine B. Johnson (Methuen).
The most important of these is in a letter from Donne to Bernard Barton,
dated from Bury St. Edmunds, September 12th, 1848:
</p><p>
'We have had a great man here, and I have been walking with him and
aiding him to eat salmon and mutton and drink port&mdash;George Borrow; and
what is more, we fell in with some gypsies and I heard the speech of
Egypt, which sounded wonderously like a medley of broken Spanish and dog
Latin. Borrow's face lighted by the red turf fire of the tent was worth
looking at. He is ashy white now, but twenty years ago, when his hair
was like a raven's wing, he must have been hard to discriminate from a
born Bohemian. Borrow is best on the tramp, if you can walk four and a
half miles per hour&mdash;as I can with ease and do by choice&mdash;and can walk
fifteen of them at a stretch&mdash;which I can compass also&mdash;then he will
talk Iliads of adventures even better than his printed ones. He cannot
abide those amateur pedestrians who saunter, and in his chair he is
given to groan and be contradictory. But on Newmarket Heath, in Rougham
Woods, he is at home, and specially when he meets with a thorough
vagabond like your present correspondent.'
</p><p>
In June 1874 FitzGerald writes to Donne:
</p><p>
'I saw in some <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> a somewhat contemptuous notice of G. B.'s
<i>Rommany Lil</i> or whatever the name is. I can easily understand that B.
should not meddle with <i>science</i> of any sort; but some years ago he
would not have liked to be told so; however, old age may have cooled him
now.'</p></div>

<h3><i>WILD WALES</i></h3>


<p>The year 1854 was an adventurous one in Borrow's life, for he, so
essentially a Celt, as Mr. Watts-Dunton has more than once reminded
us,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> had in that year two interesting experiences of the 'Celtic
Fringe.' He spent the first months of the year in Cornwall, as we have
seen, and from July to November he was in Wales. That tour he recorded
in pencilled notebooks, four of which are in the Knapp Collection in New
York, and are duly referred to in Dr. Knapp's biography, and two of
which are in my possession. In addition to this I have the complete
manuscript of <i>Wild Wales</i> in Borrow's handwriting, and many variants of
it in countless, carefully written pages. Therein lie the possibilities
of a singularly interesting edition of <i>Wild Wales</i> should opportunity
offer for its publication. When I examine the manuscript, with its
demonstration of careful preparation, I do not wonder that it took
Borrow eight years&mdash;from 1854 to 1862&mdash;to prepare this book for the
press. Assuredly we recognise here, as in all his books, that he
realised Carlyle's definition of genius&mdash;'the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> transcendent capacity of
taking trouble&mdash;first of all.'</p>

Two pages from one of George Borrow&#39;s Pocket-books with pencilled notes
made on his journey through Wales.</span>
</div>

<p>It was on 27th July 1854 that Borrow, his wife and her daughter,
Henrietta Clarke, set out on their journey to North Wales. Dr. Knapp
prints two kindly letters from Mrs. Borrow to her mother-in-law written
from Llangollen on this tour. 'We are in a lovely quiet spot,' she
writes, 'Dear George goes out exploring the mountains.... The poor here
are humble, simple,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> and good.' In the second letter Mrs. Borrow records
that her husband 'keeps a <i>daily</i> journal of all that goes on, so that
he can make a most amusing book in a month.' Yet Borrow took eight years
to make it. The failure of <i>The Romany Rye</i>, which was due for
publication before <i>Wild Wales</i>, accounts for this, and perhaps also the
disappointment that another book, long since ready, did not find a
publisher. In the letter from which I have quoted Mary Borrow tells Anne
Borrow that her son will, she expects at Christmas, publish <i>The Romany
Rye</i>, 'together with his poetry in all the European languages.' This
last book had been on his hands for many a day, and indeed in <i>Wild
Wales</i> he writes of 'a mountain of unpublished translations' of which
this book, duly advertised in <i>The Romany Rye</i>, was a part.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>After an ascent of Snowdon arm in arm with Henrietta, Mrs. Borrow
remaining behind, Borrow left his wife and daughter to find their way
back to Yarmouth, and continued his journey, all of which is most
picturesquely described in <i>Wild Wales</i>. Before that book was published,
however, Borrow was to visit the Isle of Man, Scotland, and Ireland. He
was to publish <i>Lavengro</i> (1857); to see his mother die (1858); and to
issue his very limited edition of <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> (1860); and,
lastly, to remove to Brompton (1860). It was at the end of the year 1862
that <i>Wild Wales</i> was published. It had been written during the two
years immediately following the tour in Wales, in 1855 and 1856. It had
been announced as ready for publication in 1857, but doubtless the
chilly reception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> of <i>The Romany Rye</i> in that year, of which we have
written, had made Borrow lukewarm as to venturing once more before the
public. The public was again irresponsive. <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>, then
edited by Thackeray, declared the book to be 'tiresome reading.' The
<i>Spectator</i> reviewer was more kindly, but nowhere was there any
enthusiasm. Only a thousand copies were sold,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and a second edition
did not appear until 1865, and not another until seven years after
Borrow's death. Yet the author had the encouragement that comes from
kindly correspondents. Here, for example, is a letter that could not but
have pleased him:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">West Hill Lodge, Highgate</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Dec. 29th, 1862.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We have had a great Christmas pleasure this
year&mdash;the reading of your <i>Wild Wales</i>, which has taken us so
deliciously into the lovely fresh scenery and life of that
pleasant mountain-land. My husband and myself made a little
walking tour over some of your ground in North Wales this year;
my daughter and her uncle, Richard Howitt, did the same; and we
have been ourselves collecting material for a work, the scenes
of which will be laid amidst some of our and your favourite
mountains. But the object of my writing was not to tell you
this; but after assuring you of the pleasure your work has
given us&mdash;to say also that in one respect it has tantalised us.
You have told over and over again to fascinated audiences, Lope
de Vega's ghost story, but still leave the poor reader at the
end of the book longing to hear it in vain.</p>

<p>May I ask you, therefore, to inform us in which of Lope de
Vega's numerous works this same ghost story is to be found? We
like ghost stories, and to a certain extent believe in them, we
deserve therefore to know the best ghost story in the world:</p>

<p>Wishing for you, your wife and your Henrietta, all the
compliments of the season in the best and truest of
expression.&mdash;I am, dear sir, yours sincerely,</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>The reference to Lope de Vega's ghost story is due to the fact that in
the fifty-fifth chapter of <i>Wild Wales</i>, Borrow, after declaring that
Lope de Vega was 'one of the greatest geniuses that ever lived,' added,
that among his tales may be found 'the best ghost story in the world.'
Dr. Knapp found the story in Borrow's handwriting among the manuscripts
that came to him, and gives it in full. In good truth it is but
moderately interesting, although Borrow seems to have told it to many
audiences when in Wales, but this perhaps provides the humour of the
situation. It seems clear that Borrow contemplated publishing Lope de
Vega's ghost story in a later book. We note here, indeed, a letter of a
much later date in which Borrow refers to the possibility of a
supplement to <i>Wild Wales</i>, the only suggestion of such a book that I
have seen, although there is plenty of new manuscript in my Borrow
collection to have made such a book possible had Borrow been encouraged
by his publisher and the public to write it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<h3>To J. Evan Williams, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">22 <span class="smcap">Hereford Square, Brompton</span>, <i>Decr. 31, 1863.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received your letter and thank you for the
kind manner in which you are pleased to express yourself
concerning me. Now for your questions. With respect to Lope De
Vega's ghost story, I beg to say that I am thinking of
publishing a supplement to my <i>Wild Wales</i> in which, amongst
other things, I shall give a full account of the tale and point
out where it is to be found. You cannot imagine the number of
letters I receive on the subject of that ghost story. With
regard to the Sclavonian languages, I wish to observe that they
are all well deserving of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> study. The Servian and Bohemian
contain a great many old traditionary songs, and the latter
possesses a curious though not very extensive prose literature.
The Polish has, I may say, been rendered immortal by the
writings of Mickiewicz, whose 'Conrad Wallenrod' is probably
the most remarkable poem of the present century. The Russian,
however, is the most important of all the Sclavonian tongues,
not on account of its literature but because it is spoken by
fifty millions of people, it being the dominant speech from the
Gulf of Finland to the frontiers of China. There is a
remarkable similarity both in sound and sense between many
Russian and Welsh words, for example 'tchel&oacute;' ([Russian]) is
the Russian for forehead, 'tal' is Welsh for the same; 'iasnhy'
(neuter 'iasnoe') is the Russian for clear or radiant, 'iesin'
the Welsh, so that if it were grammatical in Russian to place
the adjective after the noun as is the custom in Welsh, the
Welsh compound 'Taliesin' (Radiant forehead) might be rendered
in Russian by 'Tchel&#333;iasnoe,' which would be wondrously like
the Welsh name; unfortunately, however, Russian grammar would
compel any one wishing to Russianise 'Taliesin' to say not
'Tchel&#333;iasnoe' but 'Iasnoetchelo.'&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">George Borrow.</span><br />
</p>

</div>

<p>Another letter that Borrow owed to his <i>Wild Wales</i> may well have place
here. It will be recalled that in his fortieth chapter he waxes
enthusiastic over Lewis Morris, the Welsh bard, who was born in Anglesey
in 1700 and died in 1765. Morris's great-grandson, Sir Lewis Morris
(1833-1907), the author of the once popular <i>Epic of Hades</i>, was
twenty-nine years of age when he wrote to Borrow as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Reform Club</span>, <i>Dec. 29, 1862.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just finished reading your work on <i>Wild Wales</i>,
and cannot refrain from writing to thank you for the very
lifelike picture of the Welsh people, North and South, which,
unlike other Englishmen, you have managed to give us. To
ordinary Englishmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> the language is of course an
insurmountable bar to any real knowledge of the people, and the
result is that within six hours of Paddington or Euston Square
is a country nibbled at superficially by droves of
holiday-makers, but not really better known than Asia Minor. I
wish it were possible to get rid of all obstacles which stand
in the way of the development of the Welsh people and the Welsh
intellect. In the meantime every book which like yours tends to
lighten the thick darkness which seems to hang round Wales
deserves the acknowledgments of every true Welshman. I am,
perhaps, more especially called upon to express my thanks for
the very high terms in which you speak of my great-grandfather,
Lewis Morris. I believe you have not said a word more than he
deserves. Some of the facts which you mention with regard to
him were unknown to me, and as I take a very great interest in
everything relating to my ancestor I venture to ask you whether
you can indicate any source of knowledge with regard to him and
his wife, other than those which I have at present&mdash;viz. an old
number of the <i>Cambrian Register</i> and some notices of him in
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1760-70. There is also a letter of
his in Lord Teignmouth's <i>Life of Sir William Jones</i> in which
he claims kindred with that great scholar. Many of his
manuscript poems and much correspondence are now in the library
of the British Museum, most of them I regret to say a sealed
book to one who like myself had yet to learn Welsh. But I am
not the less anxious to learn all that can be ascertained about
my great ancestor. I should say that two of his brothers,
Richard and William, were eminent Welsh scholars.</p>

<p>With apologies for addressing you so unceremoniously, and with
renewed thanks, I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p></div>

yet published ventures to say how great has been his delight in
reading <i>Wild Wales</i>. No philologist or linguist, I am yet an
untiring walker and versifier: and really I think that few
things are pleasanter than to walk and to versify. Also, well
do I love good ale, natural drink of the English. If I could

England. Sorry and ashamed to see a Russell bullying and
insulting them.</p></div>

<p>How greatly Borrow was disappointed at the comparative failure of <i>Wild
Wales</i> may be gathered from a curt message to his publisher which I find
among his papers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Borrow has been applied to by a country bookseller, who is
desirous of knowing why there is not another edition of <i>Wild
Wales</i>, as he cannot procure a copy of the book, for which he
receives frequent orders. That it was not published in a cheap
form as soon as the edition of 1862 was exhausted has caused
much surprise.</p></div>

<p>Borrow, it will be remembered, left Wales at Chepstow, as recorded in
the hundred and ninth and final chapter of <i>Wild Wales</i>, 'where I
purchased a first class ticket, and ensconcing myself in a comfortable
carriage, was soon on my way to London, where I arrived at about four
o'clock in the morning.' In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> following letter to his wife there is a
slight discrepancy, of no importance, as to time:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. George Borrow</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">53a Pall Mall, London</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Wife Carreta</span>,&mdash;I arrived here about five o'clock this
morning&mdash;time I saw you. I have walked about 250 miles. I
walked the whole way from the North to the South&mdash;then turning
to the East traversed Glamorganshire and the county of
Monmouth, and came out at Chepstow. My boots were worn up by
the time I reached Swansea, and was obliged to get them new
soled and welted. I have seen wonderful mountains, waterfalls,
and people. On the other side of the Black Mountains I met a
cartload of gypsies; they were in a dreadful rage and were
abusing the country right and left. My last ninety miles proved
not very comfortable, there was so much rain. Pray let me have
some money by Monday as I am nearly without any, as you may
well suppose, for I was three weeks on my journey. I left you
on a Thursday, and reached Chepstow yesterday, Thursday,
evening. I hope you, my mother, and Hen. are well. I have seen
Murray and Cooke.&mdash;God bless you, yours,</p></div>

<p>Before Borrow put the finishing touches to <i>Wild Wales</i> he repeated his
visit of 1854. This was in 1857, the year of <i>The Romany Rye</i>. Dr. Knapp
records the fact through a letter to Mr. John Murray from Shrewsbury, in
which he discusses the possibility of a second edition of <i>The Romany
Rye</i>: 'I have lately been taking a walk in Wales of upwards of five
hundred miles,' he writes. This tour lasted from August 23rd to October
5th. I find four letters to his wife that were written in this holiday.
He does not seem to have made any use of this second tour in his <i>Wild
Wales</i>, although I have abundance of manuscript notes upon it in my
possession.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>Wild Wales</i> we have George Borrow in his most genial mood. There are
none of the hairbreadth escapes and grim experiences of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, none of the romance and the glamour of <i>Lavengro</i> and its
sequel, but there is good humour, a humour that does not obtain in the
three more important works, and there is an amazing amount of frank
candour of a biographical kind. We even have a reference to Isopel
Berners, referred to by Captain Bosvile as 'the young woman you used to
keep company with ... a fine young woman and a virtuous.' It is the
happiest of Borrow's books, and not unnaturally. He was having a genuine
holiday, and he had the companionship during a part of it of his wife
and daughter, of whom he was, as this book is partly written to prove,
very genuinely fond. He also enjoyed the singularly felicitous
experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span> harking back upon some of his earliest memories. He was
able to retrace the steps he took in the Welsh language during his
boyhood:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That night I sat up very late reading the life of Twm O'r Nant,
written by himself in choice Welsh.... The life I had read in
my boyhood in an old Welsh magazine, and I now read it again
with great zest, and no wonder, as it is probably the most
remarkable autobiography ever penned.</p></div>

<p>It is in this ecstatic mood that he passes through Wales. Let me recall
the eulogy on 'Gronwy' Owen, and here it may be said that Borrow rarely
got his spelling correct of the proper names of his various literary
heroes, in the various Norse and Celtic tongues in which he
delighted.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> But how much Borrow delighted in his poets may be seen
by his eulogy on Goronwy Owen, which in its pathos recalls Carlyle's
similar eulogies over poor German scholars who interested him, Jean Paul
Richter and Heyne, for example. Borrow ignored Owen's persistent
intemperance and general impracticability. Here and here only, indeed,
does he remind one of Carlyle.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> He had a great capacity for
hero-worship, although the two were not interested in the same heroes.
His hero-worship of Owen took him over large tracks of country in search
of that poet's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span> birthplace. He writes of the delight he takes in
inspecting the birth-places and haunts of poets. 'It is because I am
fond of poetry, poets, and their haunts, that I am come to
Anglesey.'<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> 'I proceeded on my way,' he says elsewhere, 'in high
spirits indeed, having now seen not only the tomb of the Tudors, but one
of those sober poets for which Anglesey has always been so famous.' And
thus it is that <i>Wild Wales</i> is a high-spirited book, which will always
be a delight and a joy not only to Welshmen, who, it may be hoped, have
by this time forgiven 'the ecclesiastical cat' of Llangollen, but to all
who rejoice in the great classics of the English tongue.</p>

<h3>LIFE IN LONDON, 1860-1874</h3>


<p>George Borrow's earlier visits to London are duly recorded, with that
glamour of which he was a master, in the pages of <i>Lavengro</i>. Who can
cross London Bridge even to-day without thinking of the apple-woman and
her copy of <i>Moll Flanders</i>; and many passages of Borrow's great book
make a very special appeal to the lover of London. Then there was that
visit to the Bible Society's office made on foot from Norwich, and the
expedition a few months later to pass an examination in the Manchu
language. When he became a country squire and the author of the very
successful <i>Bible in Spain</i> Borrow frequently visited London, and his
various residences may be traced from his letters. Take, for example,
these five notes to his wife, the first apparently written in 1848, but
all undated:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Wife</span>,&mdash;I just write you a line to tell you that I am
tolerably well as I hope you are. Every thing is in confusion
abroad. The French King has disappeared and will probably never
be heard of, though they are expecting him in England. Funds
are down nearly to eighty. The Government have given up the
income tax and people are very glad of it. <i>I am not.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> With
respect to the funds, if I were to sell out I should not know

time. Yesterday I went to Greenwich to see the Leviathan. It is
almost terrible to look at, and seems too large for the river.
It resembles a floating town&mdash;the paddle is 60 feet high. A
tall man can stand up in the funnel as it lies down. 'Tis sad,
however, that money is rather scarce. I walked over Blackheath
and thought of poor dear Mrs. Watson. I have just had a note

I miss very much my walks at Llangollen by the quiet canal; but
what's to be done? Everything seems nearly at a standstill in

me the English are getting the worst, notwithstanding their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
boasting. They thought to settle it in an autumn's day; they
little knew the Russians, and they did not reflect that just
after autumn comes winter, which has ever been the Russians'
friend. Have you heard anything about the rent of the Cottage?
I should have been glad to hear from you this morning. Give my

to whom I mentioned the F.T., says that Murray was delighted
with the idea, and will be very glad of the 4th of <i>Lavengro</i>.
I am going to dine with Murray to-day, Thursday. W. called upon
me to-day. I wish you would send me a blank cheque, in a letter
so that if I want money I may be able to draw for a little. I

<p>It was in the year 1843 that Borrow, on a visit to London following upon
the success of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, sat to Henry Wyndham Phillips for
his portrait at the instigation of Mr. Murray, who gave Borrow a
replica, retaining for himself Phillips's more finished picture, which
has been reproduced again and again in the present Mr. Murray's Borrow
productions.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Borrow was in London in 1845 and again in 1848. There must have been
other occasional visits on the way to this or that starting point of his
annual holiday, but in 1860 Borrow took a house in London, and he
resided there until 1874, when he returned to Oulton. In a letter to Mr.
John Murray, written from Ireland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> in November 1859, Mrs. Borrow writes
to the effect that in the spring of the following year she will wish to
look round 'and select a pleasant holiday residence within three to ten
miles of London.' There is no doubt that a succession of winters on
Oulton Broad had been very detrimental to Mrs. Borrow's health, although
they had no effect upon Borrow, who bathed there with equal indifference
in winter as in summer, having, as he tells us in <i>Wild Wales</i>, 'always
had the health of an elephant.' And so Borrow and his wife arrived in
London in June, and took temporary lodgings at 21 Montagu Street,
Portman Square. In September they went into occupation of a house in
Brompton&mdash;22 Hereford Square, which is now commemorated by a County
Council tablet. Here Borrow resided for fourteen years, and here his
wife died on January 30, 1869. She was buried in Brompton Cemetery,
where Borrow was laid beside her twelve years later. For neighbour, on
the one side, the Borrows had Mr. Robert Collinson and, on the other,
Miss Frances Power Cobbe and her companion, Miss M. C. Lloyd. From Miss
Cobbe we have occasional glimpses of Borrow, all of them unkindly. She
was of Irish extraction, her father having been grandson of Charles
Cobbe, Archbishop of Dublin. Miss Cobbe was an active woman in all kinds
of journalistic and philanthropic enterprises in the London of the
'seventies and 'eighties of the last century, writing in particular in
the now defunct newspaper, the <i>Echo</i>, and she wrote dozens of books and
pamphlets, all of them forgotten except her <i>Autobiography</i>,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> in
which she devoted several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> pages to her neighbour in Hereford Square.
Borrow had no sympathy with fanatical women with many 'isms,' and the
pair did not agree, although many neighbourly courtesies passed between
them for a time. Here is an extract from Miss Cobbe's <i>Autobiography</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>George Borrow, who, if he were not a gypsy by blood, <i>ought</i> to
have been one, was for some years our near neighbour in
Hereford Square. My friend<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> was amused by his quaint
stories and his (real or sham) enthusiasm for Wales, and
cultivated his acquaintance. I never liked him, thinking him
more or less of a hypocrite. His missions, recorded in <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, and his translations of the Scriptures into
the out-of-the-way tongues, for which he had a gift, were by no
means consonant with his real opinions concerning the veracity
of the said Bible.</p></div>

<p>One only needs to quote this by the light of the story as told so far in
these pages to see how entirely Miss Cobbe misunderstood Borrow, or
rather how little insight she was able to bring to a study of his
curious character. The rest of her attempt at interpretation is largely
taken up to demonstrate how much more clever and more learned she was
than Borrow. Altogether it is a sorry spectacle this of the
pseudo-philanthropist relating her conversations with a man broken by
misfortune and the death of his wife. Many of Miss Cobbe's statements
have passed into current biographies and have doubtless found
acceptance.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> I do not find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> them convincing. Archdeacon Whately on
the other hand tells us that he always found Borrow 'most civil and
hospitable,' and his sister gives us the following 'impression':</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When Mr. Borrow returned from this Spanish journey, which had
been full, as we all know, of most entertaining adventures,
related with much liveliness and spirit by himself, he was
regarded as a kind of 'lion' in the literary circles of London.
When we first saw him it was at the house of a lady who took
great pleasure in gathering 'celebrities' in various ways
around her, and our party was struck with the appearance of
this renowned traveller&mdash;a tall, thin, spare man with
prematurely white hair and intensely dark eyes, as he stood
upright against the wall of one of the drawing-rooms and
received the homage of lion-hunting guests, and listened in
silence to their unsuccessful attempts to make him talk.'<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p></div>

<p>Another reminiscence of Borrow in London is furnished by Mr. A. T.
Story, who writes:<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I had the pleasure of meeting Borrow on several occasions in
London some forty years ago. I cannot be quite certain of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
year, but I think it was either in 1872 or '73. I saw him first
in James Burns's publishing office in Southampton Row. I
happened to call just as a tall, strongly-built man with an
unforgettable face was leaving. When he had gone, Mr. Burns
asked: 'Do you know who that gentleman was?' and when I said I
did not, he said: 'He is the man whose book, <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, I saw you take down from the shelf there the other day
and read.' 'What, George Borrow?' I exclaimed. He nodded, and
then said Borrow had called several times.</p>

<p>A few days later I had an opportunity of making the good man's
acquaintance and hearing a conversation between him and Mr.
Burns. They talked about Spiritualism, with which Borrow had
very little patience, though, after some talk he consented to
attend a s&eacute;ance to be held that evening in Burns's
drawing-room. We sat together, and I had the pleasure of
hearing from time to time his grunts of disapproval. When the
discourse&mdash;'in trance'&mdash;was over, he asked me if I believed in
'this sort of thing,' and when I said I was simply an
investigator he remarked, 'That's all right, I, too, am an
investigator&mdash;of things in general&mdash;and it would not take me
long to sum up that little man (the medium) as a humbug, but a
very clever humbug.'</p>

<p>That evening I had a long walk and a talk with him, and after
that several other opportunities of talk, the last being one
night when I chanced upon him on Westminster Bridge. It was a
superb starlight night, and he was standing about midway over
the bridge gazing down into the river. When I approached him he
said: 'I have been standing here for twenty minutes looking
round and meditating. There is not another city like this in
the world, nor another bridge like this, nor a river, nor a
Parliament House like that&mdash;with its little men making little
laws&mdash;which the Lawgiver that made yonder stars&mdash;look at
them!&mdash;is continually confounding&mdash;and will confound. O, we
little men! How long before we are dust? And the stars there,
how they smile at our puny lives and tricks&mdash;here to-day, gone
to-morrow. And yet to-night how glorious it is to be here!'</p>

<p>So he rhapsodised. And then it was, 'Where can we get a bite
and sup? I've been footing it all day among the hills
there&mdash;the Surrey Hills&mdash;for a breath of fresh air.'</p>

<p>In appearance, at the time I knew him, Borrow was neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> thin
nor stout, but well proportioned and apparently of great
strength.</p></div>

<p>During this sojourn in London, which was undertaken because Oulton and
Yarmouth did not agree with his wife, Borrow suffered the tragedy of her
loss. Borrow dragged on his existence in London for another five years,
a much broken man. It is extraordinary how little we know of Borrow
during that fourteen years' sojourn in London; how rarely we meet him in
the literary memoirs of this period. Happily one or two pleasant
friendships relieved the sadness of his days; and in particular the
reminiscences of Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton assist us to a more
correct appreciation of the Borrow of these last years of London life.
Of Mr. Watts-Dunton's 'memories,' we shall write in our next chapter.
Here it remains only to note that Borrow still continued to interest
himself in his various efforts at translation, and in 1861 and 1862 the
editor of <i>Once a Week</i> printed various ballads and stories from his
pen. The volumes of this periodical are before me, and I find
illustrations by Sir John Millais, Sir E. J. Poynter, Simeon Solomon and
George Du Maurier; stories by Mrs. Henry Wood and Harriet Martineau, and
articles by Walter Thornbury.</p>

<p>In 1862 <i>Wild Wales</i> was published, as we have seen. In 1865 Henrietta
married William MacOubrey, and in the following year, Borrow and his
wife went to visit the pair in their Belfast home. In the beginning of
the year 1869 Mrs. Borrow died, aged seventy-three. There are few
records of the tragedy that are worth perpetuating.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Borrow consumed
his own smoke. With his wife's death his life was indeed a wreck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> No
wonder he was so 'rude' to that least perceptive of women, Miss Cobbe.
Some four or five years more Borrow lingered on in London, cheered at
times by walks and talks with Gordon Hake and Watts-Dunton, and he then
returned to Oulton&mdash;a most friendless man:&mdash;</p>

replica in the possession of Borrow's executor, who has kindly permitted
me to have it photographed for the purpose. There are slight and
interesting variations from Mr. Murray's portrait. Phillips (1820-1868),
the artist of these pictures, is often confused with his father, Thomas
(1770-1845), the Royal Academician and a much superior painter, who, by
the way, painted many portraits of authors for Mr. John Murray. Henry
Phillips was never an R.A. A letter from Phillips to Borrow in my
possession shows that he visited the latter at Oulton. The portrait of
Borrow is pronounced by Henry Dalrymple, his schoolfellow, from whose
manuscript we have already quoted, to be 'very like him.' This fact is
the more remarkable as the only photograph of Borrow that is known, one
taken in a group with Mrs. Simms Reeve of Norwich in 1848&mdash;five years
later&mdash;has many points of difference. The reader will here be able to
compare the two portraits in this book. A third portrait of Borrow&mdash;a
crude painting by his brother John taken in his early years, is now in
the London National Portrait Gallery.</p></div>

view:
</p><p>
'<span class="smcap">Hengwrt, Dolgelley, N. Wales</span>, <i>Jan</i>. 26, 1904.
</p><p>
'I can have no objection to your asking me if my little sketch of George
Borrow in my <i>Life</i> is my <i>dernier mot</i> about him. If I were to give my
<i>dernier mot</i>, it would be much more to his disadvantage than anything I
liked to insert in my biography. I see his American biographer has
accused me of 'bitterness.' I do not think that what is contained in my
book is 'bitter' at all. But if I were to have told my last interview
with him,&mdash;when I was driven practically to drive him out of our house,
more or less drunk, or mad with some opiate&mdash;the charge might have had
some colour. He was not a good man, and not a true or honourable one, by
any manner of means.'
</p><p>
Here assuredly we miss the fine charity which led Goethe's friend, the
Duchess of Weimar, to urge that there was a special moral law for poets.
Not for one moment does it occur to Miss Cobbe that her neighbour was a
man of genius who had written four imperishable contributions to English
literature. To her he was merely a conceited, brusque old man.
Concerning the adage that 'no man is a hero to his valet,' well may
Carlyle remark that that is more often the fault of the valet than of
the hero.</p></div>

<h3>FRIENDS OF LATER YEARS</h3>


<p>We should know little enough of George Borrow's later years, were it not
for his friendship with Thomas Gordon Hake and Theodore Watts-Dunton.
Hake was born in 1809 and died in 1895. In 1839 he settled at Bury St.
Edmunds as a physician, and he resided there until 1853. Here he was
frequently visited by the Borrows. We have already quoted his prophecy
concerning <i>Lavengro</i> that 'its roots will strike deep into the soil of
English letters.' In 1853 Dr. Hake and his family left Bury for the
United States, where they resided for some years. Returning to England
they lived at Roehampton and met Borrow occasionally in London. During
these years Hake was, according to Mr. W. M. Rossetti, 'the earthly
Providence of the Rossetti family,' but he was not, as his <i>Memoirs</i>
show, equally devoted to Borrow. In 1872, however, he went to live in
Germany and Italy for a considerable period. Concerning the relationship
between Borrow and Hake, Mr. Watts-Dunton has written:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After Hake went to live in Germany, Borrow told me a good deal
about their intimacy, and also about his own early life: for,
reticent as he naturally was, he and I got to be confidential
and intimate. His friendship with Hake began when Hake was
practising as a physician in Norfolk. It lasted during the
greater part of Borrow's later life. When Borrow was living in
London his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> great delight was to walk over on Sundays from
Hereford Square to Coombe End, call upon Hake, and take a
stroll with him over Richmond Park. They both had a passion for
herons and for deer. At that time Hake was a very intimate
friend of my own, and having had the good fortune to be
introduced by him to Borrow I used to join the two in their
walks. Afterwards, when Hake went to live in Germany, I used to
take those walks with Borrow alone. Two more interesting men it
would be impossible to meet. The remarkable thing was that
there was between them no sort of intellectual sympathy. In
style, in education, in experience, whatever Hake was, Borrow
was not. Borrow knew almost nothing of Hake's writings, either
in prose or in verse. His ideal poet was Pope, and when he
read, or rather looked into, Hake's <i>World's Epitaph</i>, he
thought he did Hake the greatest honour by saying, 'there are
lines here and there that are nigh as good as Pope'!</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hake's acquaintance with Borrow's works was
far behind that of some Borrovians who did not know Lavengro in
the flesh, such as Saintsbury and Mr. Birrell. Borrow was shy,
angular, eccentric, rustic in accent and in locution, but with
a charm for me, at least, that was irresistible. Hake was
polished, easy and urbane in everything, and, although not
without prejudice and bias, ready to shine generally in any
society.</p>

<p>So far as Hake was concerned the sole link between them was
that of reminiscence of earlier days and adventures in Borrow's
beloved East Anglia. Among many proofs I would adduce of this I
will give one. I am the possessor of the MS. of Borrow's
<i>Gypsies of Spain</i>, written partly in a Spanish notebook as he
moved about Spain in his colporteur days. It was my wish that
Hake would leave behind him some memorial of Borrow more worthy
of himself and his friend than those brief reminiscences
contained in <i>Memoirs of Eighty Years</i>. I took to Hake this
precious relic of <i>one of the most wonderful men of the
nineteenth century</i>, in order to discuss with him differences
between the MS. and the printed text. Hake was writing in his
invalid chair,&mdash;writing verses. 'What does it all matter?' he
said. 'I do not think you understand Lavengro,' I said. Hake
replied, 'And yet Lavengro had an advantage over me, for <i>he</i>
understood <i>nobody</i>. Every individuality with which he was
brought into contact had, as no one knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> better than you, to
be tinged with colours of his own before he could see it at
all.' That, of course, was true enough; and Hake's asperities
when speaking of Borrow in <i>Memoirs of Eighty
Years</i>,&mdash;asperities which have vexed a good many
Borrovians,&mdash;simply arose from the fact that it was impossible
for two such men to understand each other. When I told him of
Mr. Lang's angry onslaught upon Borrow in his notes to the
<i>Waverley Novels</i>, on account of his attacks upon Scott, he
said, 'Well, does he not deserve it?' When I told him of Miss
Cobbe's description of Borrow as a <i>poseur</i>, he said to me, 'I
told you the same scores of times. But I saw Borrow had
bewitched you during that first walk under the rainbow in
Richmond Park. It was that rainbow, I think, that befooled
you.' Borrow's affection for Hake, however, was both strong and
deep, as I saw after Hake had gone to Germany and in a way
dropped out of Borrow's ken. Yet Hake was as good a man as ever
Borrow was, and for certain others with whom he was brought in
contact as full of a genuine affection as Borrow was
himself.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton refers here to Hake's asperities when speaking of
Borrow. They are very marked in the <i>Memoirs of Eighty Years</i>, and
nearly all the stories of Borrow's eccentricities that have been served
up to us by Borrow's biographers are due to Hake. It is here we read of
his snub to Thackeray. 'Have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span> you read my Snob Papers in <i>Punch</i>?'
Thackeray asked him. 'In <i>Punch</i>?' Borrow replied. 'It is a periodical I
never look at.' He was equally rude, or shall we say Johnsonian,
according to Hake, when Miss Agnes Strickland asked him if she might
send him her <i>Queens of England</i>. He exclaimed, 'for God's sake don't,
madam; I should not know where to put them or what to do with them.'
Hake is responsible also for that other story about the woman who,
desirous of pleasing him, said, 'Oh, Mr. Borrow, I have read your books
with so much pleasure!' On which he exclaimed, 'Pray, what books do you
mean, madam? Do you mean my account books?'<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Dr. Johnson was guilty
of many such vagaries, and the readers of Boswell have forgiven him
everything because they are conveyed to them through the medium of a
hero-worshipper. Borrow never had a Boswell, and despised the literary
class so much that he never found anything in the shape of an apologist
until he had been long dead. The most competent of these, because
writing from personal knowledge, was Walter Theodore Watts-Dunton, who
is known in literature as Theodore Watts, the author of <i>Aylwin</i> and
<i>The Coming of Love</i>, and the writer of many acute and picturesque
criticisms. Mr. Watts-Dunton&mdash;who added his mother's name of Dunton to
his own in later life&mdash;was the son of a solicitor of St. Ives in
Huntingdonshire. In early life he was himself a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> solicitor, which
profession he happily abandoned for literature. His friendship with
Algernon Charles Swinburne is one of the romances of the Victorian era.
His affectionate solicitude doubtless kept that great poet alive for
many a year beyond what would otherwise have been his lot. Watts-Dunton
was, as we have seen, introduced to Borrow by Hake. He has written a
romance which, if he could be persuaded to publish it, would doubtless
command the same attention as <i>Aylwin</i>, in which Borrow is introduced as
'Dereham' and Hake as 'Gordon,' and here he tells the story of that
introduction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One day when I was sitting with him in his delightful home,
near Roehampton, whose windows at the back looked over Richmond
Park, and in front over the wildest part of Wimbledon Common,
one of his sons came in and said that he had seen Dereham
striding across the common, evidently bound for the house.</p>

<p>'Dereham,' I said, 'is there a man in the world I should so
like to see as Dereham?'</p>

<p>And then I told Gordon how I had seen him years before swimming
in the sea off Yarmouth, but had never spoken to him.</p>

<p>'Why do you want so much to see him?' asked Gordon.</p>

<p>'Well, among other things, I want to see if he is a true Child
of the Open Air.'<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p></div>

<p>I find no letter from Hake to Borrow among my papers, but three to his
wife:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Bury St. Edmunds</span>, <i>Jan. 27, '48. Evening.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Borrow</span>,&mdash;It gave me great pleasure, as it always
does, to see your handwriting; and as respects the subject of
your note you may make yourself quite easy, for I believe the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
idea has crossed no other mind than your own. How sorry I am to
learn that you have been so unwell since your visit to us. I
hope that by care you will get strong during this bracing
weather. I wish that you were already nearer to us, and cannot
resign the hope that we shall yet enjoy the happiness of having
you as our neighbours. I have felt a strong friendship for Mr.
Borrow's mind for many years, and have ardently wished from
time to time to know him, and to have realised my desire I
consider one of the most happy events of my life. Until lately,
dear Mrs. Borrow, I have had no opportunity of knowing you and
your sweet simple-hearted child; but now I hope nothing will
occur to interrupt a regard and friendship which I and Mrs.
Hake feel most truly towards you all. Tell Mr. Borrow how much
we should like to be his Sinbad. I wish he would bring you all
and his papers and come again to look about him. There is an
old hall at Tostock, which, I hear to-day, is quite dry; if so
it is worthy of your attention. It is a mile from the Elmswell
station, which is ten minutes' time from Bury. This hall has
got a bad name from having been long vacant, but some friends
of mine have been over it and they tell me there is not a damp
spot on the premises. It is seven miles from Bury. Mrs. Hake
has written about a house at Rougham, but had no answer. The
cottage at Farnham is to let again. I know not whether Mr.
Harvey will make an effort for it. A little change would do you
all good, and we can receive Miss Clarke without any
difficulty. Give our kindest regards to your party, and believe
me, dear Mrs. Borrow, sincerely yours,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Borrow</span>,&mdash;The sight of your handwriting is always a
luxury&mdash;but you say nothing about coming to see us. We are
pleased to get good accounts of your party, and only wish you
could report better of yourself. I must take you fairly in hand
when you come again to the ancient quarters, for such they are
becoming now from your long absence. You might try bismuth and
extract of hop, which is often very strengthening to the
stomach. Five grains of extract of hop and five grains of
trisnitrate of bismuth made into two pills, which are to be
taken at eleven and repeated at four&mdash;daily. I am so pleased to
learn that Miss Clarke is better, as well as Mr. Borrow. I hope
that on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> some occasion, the morphia may be of great comfort to
him should his night watchings return. It is good news that the
proofs are advancing&mdash;I hope towards a speedy end. Messrs.
Oakes and Co.'s Bank is as safe as any in the kingdom and more
substantial than any in this county. It must be safe, for the
partners are men of large property, and of careful habits. I am
happy to say we are all well here, but my brother's house in
town is a scene of sad trouble. He is himself laid up with bad
scarlet fever as well as five children, all severely attacked.
One they have lost of this fearful complaint.</p>

yourselves. Ever, dear Mrs. Borrow, sincerely yours,</p></div>

looking out anxiously for the new quarterly reviews. I wonder
whether the <i>Quarterly</i> will contain anything. Is there a
prospect of vol. iv.? I really look to passing a day and two
half days with you, and to bringing Mrs. Hake to your classic
soil some time in August&mdash;if we are not inconveniencing you in
your charming and snug cottage. I hope Miss Clarke is well. Our
united kind regards to you all. George is quite brisk and
saucy&mdash;Lucy and the infant have not been well. Mrs. Hake has
better accounts from Bath. Believe me, dear Mrs. Borrow, very
sincerely yours,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Donne was pleased that Mr. Borrow liked his notice in

<p>Mr. A. Egmont Hake, one of Dr. Hake's sons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span> has also given us an
interesting reminiscence of Borrow:<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Though he was a friend of my family before he wrote <i>Lavengro</i>,
few men have ever made so deep an impression on me as George
Borrow. His tall, broad figure, his stately bearing, his fine
brown eyes, so bright yet soft, his thick white hair, his oval,
beardless face, his loud rich voice, and bold heroic air, were
such as to impress the most indifferent of lookers-on. Added to
this there was something not easily forgotten in the manner in
which he would unexpectedly come to our gates, singing some
gipsy song, and as suddenly depart. His conversation, too, was
unlike that of any other man; whether he told a long story or
only commented on some ordinary topic, he was always quaint,
often humorous.... It was at Oulton that the author of <i>The
Bible in Spain</i> spent his happiest days. The <i>m&eacute;nage</i> in his
Suffolk home was conducted with great simplicity, but he always
had for his friends a bottle or two of wine of rare vintage,
and no man was more hearty than he over the glass. He passed
his mornings in his summer-house, writing on small scraps of
paper, and these he handed to his wife who copied them on
foolscap. It was in this way and in this retreat that the
manuscript of <i>Lavengro</i> as well as of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> was
prepared, the place of which he says, 'I hastened to my
summer-house by the side of the lake and there I thought and
wrote, and every day I repaired to the same place and thought
and wrote until I had finished <i>The Bible in Spain</i>.' In this
outdoor studio, hung behind the door, were a soldier's coat and
a sword which belonged to his father; these were household gods
on which he would often gaze while composing.</p></div>

<p>To Mr. Watts-Dunton we owe by far the best description of Borrow's
personal appearance:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What Borrow lacked in adaptability was in great degree
compensated by his personal appearance. No one who has ever
walked with him, either through the streets of London or along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
the country roads, could fail to remark how his appearance
arrested the attention of the passers-by. As a gypsy woman once
remarked to the present writer, 'Everybody as ever see'd the
white-headed Romany Rye never forgot him.' When he chanced to
meet troops marching along a country road, it was noticeable
that every soldier, whether on foot or horseback, would
involuntarily turn to look at Borrow's striking figure. He
stood considerably above six feet in height, was built as
perfectly as a Greek statue, and his practice of athletic
exercises gave his every movement the easy elasticity of an
athlete under training. Those East Anglians who have bathed
with him on the east coast, or others who have done the same in
the Thames or the Ouse, can vouch for his having been an almost
faultless model of masculine symmetry, even as an old man. With
regard to his countenance, 'noble' is the only word which can
be used to describe it. When he was quite a young man his thick
crop of hair had become of a silvery whiteness.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> There was
a striking relation between the complexion, which was as
luminous and sometimes rosy as an English girl's, and the
features&mdash;almost perfect Roman-Greek in type, with a dash of
Hebrew. To the dark lustre of the eyes an increased intensity
was lent by the fair skin. No doubt, however, what most struck
the observer was the marked individuality, not to say
singularity, of his expression. If it were possible to describe
this expression in a word or two, it might, perhaps, be called
a self-consciousness that was both proud and shy.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p></div>

<p>Here is another picture by Mr. Watts-Dunton of this London period:<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At seventy years of age, after breakfasting at eight o'clock in
Hereford Square, he would walk to Putney, meet one or more of
us at Roehampton, roam about Wimbledon and Richmond Park with
us, bathe in the Fen Ponds with a north-east wind cutting
across the icy water like a razor, run about the grass
afterwards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> like a boy to shake off some of the water-drops,
stride about the park for hours, and then, after fasting for
twelve hours, eat a dinner at Roehampton that would have done
Sir Walter Scott's eyes good to see. Finally, he would walk
back to Hereford Square, getting home late at night. And if the
physique of the man was bracing, his conversation, unless he
happened to be suffering from one of his occasional fits of
depression, was still more so. Its freshness, raciness, and
eccentric whim no pen could describe. There is a kind of
humour, the delight of which is that while you smile at the
pictures it draws, you smile quite as much to think that there
is a mind so whimsical, crotchety, and odd as to draw them.
This was the humour of Borrow.</p></div>

<p>And there is yet another description, equally illuminating, in which Mr.
Watts-Dunton records how he won Borrow's heart by showing a familiarity
with Douglas Jerrold's melodrama <i>Ambrose Gwinett</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From that time I used to see Borrow often at Roehampton,
sometimes at Putney, and sometimes, but not often, in London. I
could have seen much more of him than I did had not the
whirlpool of London, into which I plunged for a time, borne me
away from this most original of men; and this is what I so
greatly lament now: for of Borrow it may be said, as it was
said of a greater man still, that 'after Nature made <i>him</i> she
forthwith broke the mould.' The last time I ever saw him was
shortly before he left London to live in the country. It was, I
remember well, on Waterloo Bridge, where I had stopped to gaze
at a sunset of singular and striking splendour, whose gorgeous
clouds and ruddy mists were reeling and boiling over the
West-End. Borrow came up and stood leaning over the parapet,
entranced by the sight, as well he might be. Like most people
born in flat districts, he had a passion for sunsets. Turner
could not have painted that one, I think, and certainly my pen
could not describe it; for the London smoke was flushed by the
sinking sun, and had lost its dunness, and, reddening every
moment as it rose above the roofs, steeples, and towers, it
went curling round the sinking sun in a rosy vapour, leaving,
however, just a segment of a golden rim, which gleamed as
dazzlingly as in the thinnest and clearest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> air&mdash;a peculiar
effect which struck Borrow deeply. I never saw such a sunset
before or since, not even on Waterloo Bridge; and from its
association with 'the last of Borrow' I shall never forget
it.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton concludes his reminiscences&mdash;the most valuable personal
record that we have of Borrow&mdash;with a sonnet that now has its place in
literature:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We talked of 'Children of the Open Air'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who once in Orient valleys lived aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Loving the sun, the wind, the sweet reproof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of storms, and all that makes the fair earth fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, on a day, across the mystic bar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of moonrise, came the 'Children of the Roof,'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who find no balm 'neath Evening's rosiest woof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dews of peace beneath the Morning Star.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We looked o'er London where men wither and choke,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roofed in, poor souls, renouncing stars and skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And lore of woods and wild wind-prophecies&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, every voice that to their fathers spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet it seemed to die ere bricks and smoke<br /></span>

the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, January 19, 1895.
</p><p>
An interesting letter that I have received from Mr. Watts-Dunton clears
up several points and may well have place here:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<span class="smcap">The Pines</span>, 11 <span class="smcap">Putney Hill, S.W.</span>, <i>31st May 1913.</i>
</p><p>
'You ask me what I have written upon George Borrow. When Borrow
died (26th July 1881), the first obituary notice of him in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> was not by me, but by W. Elwin. This appeared on the
6th August 1881. At this time the general public had so
forgotten that Borrow was alive that I remember once, at one of
old Mrs. Procter's receptions, it had been discussed, as Lowell
and Browning afterwards told me, as to whether I was or was not
"an archer of the long bow" because I said that on the previous
Sunday I had walked with Borrow in Richmond Park, and was
frequently seeing him, and that on the Sunday before I had
walked in the same beautiful park with Dr. Gordon Latham,
another celebrity of the past "known to be dead." The fact is,
Borrow's really great books were <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany
Rye</i>, and the latter had fallen almost dead from the press,
smothered by Victorian respectability and philistinism. He was
thoroughly soured and angry, and no wonder! He fought shy of
literary society. He quite resented being introduced to
strangers.
</p><p>
'Elwin's article was considered very unsatisfactory. Knowing
that the most competent man in England to write about Borrow
was my old friend, Dr. Gordon Hake, I suggested that MacColl
should ask the doctor (one of the few men whom Borrow really
loved) to furnish the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> with another article. This was
agreed to, and another article was written, either by Dr. Hake
himself, or by one of his sons&mdash;I don't quite remember at this
distance of time. It appeared in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of the 13th
August 1881. But even this article did not seem to MacColl to
vitalise one of the most remarkable personalities of the 19th
century; and as I was then a leading writer in the literary
department of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, MacColl asked me to give him an
article upon Borrow whom I had known so well. I did so, and the
article "caught on," as MacColl said, more than had any
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> article for a long time. This appeared 3rd September
1881. When MacColl read the article he was so much pleased with
it that he urged me to follow it up with an article on Borrow
in connection with the Children of the Open Air&mdash;a subject upon
which I had previously written a good deal in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.
This appeared on the 10th September 1881, and became still more
popular, and the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> containing it had quite an
exceptional sale.
</p><p>
'The Hake whom you inquire about, Egmont Hake, has drifted out
of my ken. He at one time lived in Paris, and wrote a book
called <i>Paris Originals</i>. I know that he did, at one time,
contemplate writing upon Borrow, and corresponded with Mrs.
MacOubrey with this view; but the affair fell through. As a son
of Dr. Hake's he could not fail to know Borrow. He wrote a
brief article about him, in the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>. But the two Hakes who were thrown across Borrow
most intimately were Thomas Hake and George Hake, the latter of
whom lately died in Africa. Thomas Hake, the eldest of the
family, knew Borrow in his own childhood, which the other
members of the family did not. After Dr. Gordon Hake went to
live in Germany, after the Roehampton home was broken up, I saw
a good deal of Borrow. He always thought that no one
sympathised with him and understood him so thoroughly as I
did,&mdash;Ever most cordially yours,</p></div>

Thackeray, of whom scarcely any one has spoken ill. 'Thackeray spent a

disagreeable companion to those who did not want to boast that they knew
him.'&mdash;<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 86. 'Thackeray,' he says elsewhere, 'as if under

necessary to make a figure.... Borrow knew better how to behave in good

<h3>BORROW'S UNPUBLISHED WRITINGS</h3>


<p>To many in our day, less utilitarian than those of an earlier era,
Borrow must have been an interesting man of letters had he not written
his four great books. Single-minded devotion to the less commercially
remunerative languages has now become respectable and even estimable.
Students of the Scandinavian languages, and of the Celtic, abound in our
midst. Borrow was a forerunner with Bowring of much of this 'useless'
learning. Borrow came to consider Bowring's apparent neglect of him to
be unforgivable. But that time had not arrived, when in 1842 he wrote to
him as follows:</p>


<h3>To Dr. John Bowring</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Oulton, Lowestoft, Suffolk</span>, <i>July 14th, 1842.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Pray excuse my troubling you with a line. I
wish you would send as many of the papers and manuscripts,
which I left at yours some twelve years ago, as you can find.
Amongst others there is an essay on Welsh poetry, a translation
of the <i>Death of Balder</i>, etc. If I am spared to the beginning
of next year, I intend to bring out a volume called <i>Songs of
Denmark</i>, consisting of some selections from the <i>K&aelig;mpe Viser</i>
and specimens from Ewald, Grundtvig, Oehlenschl&auml;ger, and I
suppose I must give a few notices of those people. Have you any
history of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> Danish literature from which I could glean a few
hints. I think you have a book in two volumes containing
specimens of Danish poetry. It would be useful to me as I want
to translate Ingemann's <i>Dannebrog</i>; and one or two other
pieces. I shall preface all with an essay on the Danish
language. It is possible that a book of this description may
take, as Denmark is quite an untrodden field.</p>

<p>Could you lend me for a short time a Polish and French or
Polish and German dictionary. I am going carefully through
Makiewitz, about whom I intend to write an <i>article</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Bible in Spain</i> is in the press, and with God's permission
will appear about November in three volumes. I shall tell
Murray to send a copy to my oldest, I may say my <i>only</i> friend.
Pray let me know how you are getting on. I every now and then
see your name in the <i>Examiner</i>, the only paper I read. Should
you send the papers and the books it must be by the Yarmouth
coach which starts from Fetter Lane. Address: George Borrow,
Crown Inn, Lowestoft, Suffolk. With kindest remembrances to
Mrs. Bowring, Miss Bowring, and family&mdash;I remain, Dear Sir,
ever yours,</p></div>

<p>Now with the achieved success of <i>The Bible in Spain</i> and the leisure of
a happy home Borrow could for the moment think of the ambition of
'twelve years ago'&mdash;an ambition to put before the public some of the
results of his marvellous industry. The labours of the dark, black years
between 1825 and 1830 might now perchance see the light. Three such
books got themselves published, as we have seen, <i>Romantic Ballads</i>,
<i>Targum</i>, and <i>The Talisman</i>. <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> had been translated
and offered to 'a little Welsh bookseller' of Smithfield in 1830, who,
however, said, when he had read it, 'were I to print it I should be
ruined.' That fate followed the book to the end, and Borrow was
premature when he said in his Preface to <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> that such
folly is on the decline, because he found 'Albemarle Street in '60
willing to publish a harmless but plain-speaking book which Smithfield
shrank from in '30.' At the last moment John Murray refused to publish,
but seems to have agreed to give his imprint to the title-page. Borrow
published the book at his own expense, it being set up by James Matthew
Denew, of 72 Hall Plain, Great Yarmouth. Fourteen years later&mdash;in
1874&mdash;Mr. Murray made some amends by publishing <i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i>, in
which are many fine translations from the Romany, and that, during his
lifetime, was the 'beginning and the end' of Borrow's essays in
publishing so far as his translations were concerned. Webber, the
bookseller of Ipswich, did indeed issue <i>The Turkish Jester</i>&mdash;advertised
as ready for publication in 1857&mdash;in 1884, and Jarrold of Norwich <i>The
Death of Balder</i> in 1889; but enthusiasts have asked in vain for <i>Celtic
Bards</i>, <i>Chiefs and Kings</i>, <i>Songs of Europe</i>, and <i>Northern Skalds,
Kings and Earls</i>. It is not recorded whether Borrow offered these to any
publisher other than 'Glorious John' of Albemarle Street, but certain it
is that Mr. Murray would have none of them. The 'mountains of
manuscript' remained to be the sorrowful interest of Borrow as an old
man as they had&mdash;many of them&mdash;been the sorrow and despair of his early
manhood. Here is a memorandum in his daughter's handwriting of the work
that Borrow was engaged upon at the time of his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These translations were intended to form a volume with copious
notes, but were only completed a month before Mr. Borrow's
death, which occurred at his residence, Oulton Cottage,
Suffolk, July 26th, 1881, in the seventy-ninth year of his age.
This grand old man, full of years and honour, was buried beside
his wife (who had proved a noble helpmate to him), in Brompton
Cemetery, August 4th.</p></div>

<p>And so what many will consider Borrow's 'craze' for verse translations
remained with him to the end. We know with what equanimity he bore his
defeat in early years. Did he not make humorous 'copy' out of it in
<i>Lavengro</i>. It must have been a greater disappointment that his
publisher would have none of his wares when he had proved by writing
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> that at least some of his work had money in it. For
years it was Borrow's opinion that Lockhart stood in his way, wishing to
hold the field with his <i>Ancient Spanish Ballads</i> (1821), and
maintaining that Borrow was no poet. The view that Borrow had no poetry
in him and that his verse is always poor has been held by many of
Borrow's admirers. The view will not have the support of those who have
had the advantage of reading all Borrow's less known published writings,
and the many manuscripts that he left behind him. But on the general
question let us hear Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It should never be forgotten that Borrow was, before everything
else, a poet.... By poet I do not mean merely a man who is
skilled in writing lyrics and sonnets and that kind of thing,
but primarily a man who has the poetic gift of seeing through
'the show of things,' and knowing where he is&mdash;the gift of
drinking deeply of the waters of life, and of feeling grateful
to Nature for so sweet a draught.'<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p></div>

<p>Possibly Mr. Watts-Dunton did not contemplate his idea being applied to
Borrow's verse translations, but all the same the quality of poetic
imagination may be found here in abundance. The little Welsh bookseller
of Smithfield said to Borrow in reference to <i>The Sleeping Bard</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Were I to print it I should be ruined; the terrible description
of vice and torment would frighten the genteel part of the
English public out of its wits, and I should to a certainty be
prosecuted by Sir James Scarlett. I am much obliged to you for
the trouble you have given yourself on my account&mdash;but, Myn
Diawl! I had no idea, till I had read him in English, that Elis
Wyn had been such a terrible fellow.</p></div>

<p>And here the little Welsh bookseller paid Borrow a signal compliment. In
the main Borrow provided a prose translation of <i>The Sleeping Bard</i>. In
<i>Targum</i> however, he showed himself a quite gifted balladist, far
removed from the literary standard of <i>Romantic Ballads</i> ten years
earlier. Space does not permit of any quotation in this chapter, and I
must be content here to declare that the spirit of poetry came over
Borrow on many occasions. The whole of Borrow's <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i>
will ultimately be published, although for eighty and more years<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
the pile of neatly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> written manuscript of that book, which is now in my
possession, has appealed for publication in vain. There will be found,
in such a ballad as <i>Orm Ungerswayne</i>, for example, a practical
demonstration that Borrow had the root of the matter in him. It is true
that Borrow's limited acquaintance with English poetry was a serious
drawback to great achievement, and his many translations from his
favourite Welsh bard Goronwy Owen that are before me are too much under
the influence of Pope. In addition to the <i>Songs of Scandinavia</i> I have
before me certain other ballads in manuscript&mdash;such portions of his
various unpublished but frequently advertised works as did not fall to
Dr. Knapp.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Of these I do not hesitate to say that whatever the
difference of opinion as to their poetic quality there can be no
difference of opinion as to their being well-told stories of an
exceedingly interesting and invigorating character. But I must leave for
another time and another opportunity any discussion of Borrow's poetic
achievement of which at present the world has had little opportunity of
knowing anything.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Of prose manuscript there is also a considerable
quantity, including diaries of travel and translations of nine or ten
stories from various languages. Of the minor books already published we
have already spoken of <i>Faustus</i>, <i>Romantic Ballads</i>, <i>Targum</i>, and <i>The
Talisman</i>, and Borrow's last and least interesting book <i>Romano
Lavo-Lil</i>. There remains but to recall:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>These eight little volumes will always remain Borrow's least-read books.
Only in <i>Targum</i> and <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> do we find much indication of
those qualities which made him famous. It is not in the least surprising
that the other work failed to find a publisher, and, indeed, from a
merely commercial point of view, the late John Murray had more excuse
for refusing <i>Romano Lavo-Lil,</i> which he did publish, than <i>The Sleeping
Bard</i>, which he refused to publish&mdash;at least on his own responsibility.
Such books, whatever their merits, are issued to-day only by learned
societies. In a quite different category were those many ballads<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
from diverse languages that Borrow had hoped to issue under such titles
as <i>Celtic Bards</i>, <i>Chiefs and Kings</i>, and <i>Northern Skalds, Kings and
Earls</i>. These books would have had no difficulty in finding a publisher
to-day were they offered by a writer of one half the popularity of
Borrow.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>There is, I repeat, excellent work in these ballads. As to <i>Targum</i> let
it not be forgotten that Hasfeld&mdash;really a good judge&mdash;said in <i>The
Athen&aelig;um</i> that 'the work is a pearl of genius,' and that William Bodham
Donne declared that 'the language and rhythm are vastly superior to
Macaulay's <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>.' As to <i>The Sleeping Bard</i> Borrow
himself was able to make his own vigorous defence of that work. In
emulation of Walter Scott he reviewed himself in <i>The Quarterly</i>.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
His article is really an essay on Welsh poetry, and incidentally he
quotes from his unpublished <i>Celtic Bards, Chiefs and Kings</i> a lengthy
passage, the manuscript of which is in my possession. We are introduced
again to all Borrow's old friends of <i>Wild Wales</i>: Hew Morris, Goronwy
Owen, and finally Elis Wyn. Borrow quotes from <i>The Romany Rye</i>, but as
becomes a reviewer of his own book, gives no praise to his achievement.</p>

<p>I find no plays among Borrow's 'mountains of manuscript' in my
possession, and so I am not disposed to accept the suggestion that the
following letter from Gifford to Borrow refers to a play which Borrow
pretended to be the work of a friend while it was really his own. If it
was his own he doubtless took Gifford's counsel to heart and promptly
destroyed the manuscript:&mdash;</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A Specimen of Gifford's criticism on a friend's</i> play, <i>which
I was desired to send to him</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Borrow</span>,&mdash;I have read your M.S. very attentively, and
may say of it with Desdemona of the  song&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">'It is silly, sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dallies with the innocence of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to old age.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The poetry in some places is pretty, the sentiment is also
excellent. And can I say more? The plot is petty, the
characters without vigour, and the story poorly told. Instead
of Irene the scene seems to be laid in Arcadia, and the manners
are not so much confounded as totally lost. There are
Druids&mdash;but such Druids! O Lord!</p>

<p>There is to be seen no physical, perhaps no moral lesson,
though a Druid should not be a rogue&mdash;but it is not so set down
in the bond. Is this the characterisation which we have been
used to see there? To end an unpleasant letter, I must leave
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> your friendship for the author to contrive some mode of
dissuading him from publishing. If, however, he is determined
to rush on the world, let him do it, in the first place,
anonymously. If it takes, he may then toss up his nose at my
opinion, and claim his work.</p></div>

<p>Your answer is short. The play might have passed very well had
it been published when written, and when the writer was yet
young and little known, but it will be hazardous now, as the
world is cross-grained, and will not see your master in the
grave and learned author of so many valuable works; but judge
him from his present attainments. But this, as Mrs. Quickly
says, 'is alligant terms,' and it may do.&mdash;Ever yours,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Wm. Gifford.</span></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I see the preface is already written, and do what you
will, the play will be published.</p></div>

<p>One other phase of this more limited aspect of Borrow's work may be
dealt with here&mdash;his mastery of languages. I have before me scores of
pages which reveal the way that Borrow became a lav-engro&mdash;a
word-master. He drew up tables of every language in turn, the English
word following the German, or Welsh, or whatever the tongue might be,
and he learnt these off with amazing celerity. His wonderful memory was
his greatest asset in this particular. He was not a philologist if we
accept the dictionary definition of that word as 'a person versed in the
science of language.' But his interest in languages is refreshing and
interesting&mdash;never pedantic, and he takes rank among those disinterested
lovers of learning who pursue their researches without any regard to the
honours or emoluments that they may bring, loving learning for
learning's sake, undaunted by the discouragements that come from the
indifference of a world to which they have made their appeal in vain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>HENRIETTA CLARKE</h3>


<p>Borrow never had a child, but happy for him was the part played by his
stepdaughter Henrietta in his life. She was twenty-three years old when
her mother married him, and it is clear to me that she was from the
beginning of their friendship and even to the end of his life devoted to
her stepfather. Readers of <i>Wild Wales</i> will recall not only the tribute
that Borrow pays to her, which we have already quoted, in which he
refers to her 'good qualities and many accomplishments,' but the other
pleasant references in that book. 'Henrietta,' he says in one passage,
'played on the guitar<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and sang a Spanish song, to the great delight
of John Jones.' When climbing Snowdon he is keen in his praises of the
endurance of 'the gallant girl.' As against all this, there is an
undercurrent of depreciation of his stepdaughter among Borrow's
biographers. The picture of Borrow's home in later life at Oulton is
presented by them with sordid details. The Oulton tradition which still
survives among the few inhabitants who lived near the Broad at Borrow's
death in 1881, and still reside there, is of an ill-kept home, supremely
untidy, and it is as a final indictment of his daughter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> callousness
that we have the following gruesome picture by Dr. Knapp:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the 26th of July 1881 Mr. Borrow was found dead in his house
at Oulton. The circumstances were these. His stepdaughter and
her husband drove to Lowestoft in the morning on some business
of their own, leaving Mr. Borrow without a living soul in the
house with him. He had earnestly requested them not to go away
because he felt that he was in a dying state; but the response
intimated that he had often expressed the same feeling before,
and his fears had proved groundless. During the interval of
these few hours of abandonment nothing can palliate or excuse,
George Borrow died as he had lived&mdash;<i>alone</i>! His age was
seventy-eight years and twenty-one days.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Knapp no doubt believed all this;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> it is endorsed by the village
gossip of the past thirty years, and the mythical tragedy is even
heightened by a further story of a farm tumbril which carried poor
Borrow's body to the railway station when it was being conveyed to
London to be buried beside his wife in Brompton Cemetery.</p>

<p>The tumbril story&mdash;whether correct or otherwise&mdash;is a matter of
indifference to me. The legend of the neglect of Borrow in his last
moments is however of importance, and the charge can easily be
disproved.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> I have before me Mrs. MacOubrey's diary for 1881.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>I have many such diaries for a long period of years, but this for 1881
is of particular moment. Here, under the date July 26th, we find the
brief note, <i>George Borrow died at three o'clock this morning</i>. It is
scarcely possible that Borrow's stepdaughter and her husband could have
left him alone at three o'clock in the morning in order to drive into
Lowestoft, less than two miles distant. At this time, be it remembered,
Dr. MacOubrey was eighty-one years of age. Now, as to the general
untidiness of Borrow's home at the time of his death&mdash;the point is a
distasteful one, but it had better be faced. Henrietta was twenty-three
years of age when her mother married Borrow. She was sixty-four at the
time of his death, and her husband, as I have said, was eighty-one years
of age at that time, being three years older than Borrow. Here we have
three very elderly people keeping house together and little accustomed
overmuch to the assistance of domestic servants. The situation at once
becomes clear. Mrs. Borrow had a genius for housekeeping and for
management. She watched over her husband, kept his accounts, held the
family purse,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> managed all his affairs. She 'managed' her daughter
also, delighting in that daughter's accomplishments of drawing and
botany, to which may be added a zeal for the writing of stories which
does not seem, judging from the many manuscripts in her handwriting that
I have burnt, to have received much editorial encouragement. In short,
Henrietta was not domesticated. But just as I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span> proved in preceding
chapters that Borrow was happy in his married life, so I would urge that
as far as a somewhat disappointed career would permit to the sadly
bereaved author he was happy in his family circle to the end. It was at
his initiative that, when he had returned to Oulton after the death of
his wife, his daughter and her husband came to live with him. He
declared that to live alone was no longer tolerable, and they gave up
their own home in London to join him at Oulton.</p>

<p>A new glimpse of Borrow on his domestic side has been offered to the
public even as this book is passing through the press. Mr. S. H.
Baldrey, a Norwich solicitor, has given his reminiscences of the author
of <i>Lavengro</i> to the leading newspaper of that city.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Mr. Baldrey is
the stepson of the late John Pilgrim of the firm of Jay and Pilgrim, who
were Borrow's solicitors at Norwich in the later years of his life. One
at least of Mr. Baldrey's many reminiscences has in it an element of
romance; that in which he recalls Mrs. Borrow and her daughter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Borrow always struck me as a dear old creature. When
Borrow married her she was a widow with one daughter, Henrietta
Clarke. The old lady used to dress in black silk. She had
little silver-grey corkscrew curls down the side of her face;
and she wore a lace cap with a mauve ribbon on top, quite in
the Early Victorian style. I remember that on one occasion when
she and Miss Clarke had come to Brunswick House they were
talking with my mother in the temporary absence of George
Borrow, who, so far as I can recall, had gone into another room
to discuss business with John Pilgrim.</p>

<p>'Ah!' she said, 'George is a good man, but he is a strange
creature. Do you know he will say to me after breakfast,
"Mary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> I am going for a walk," and then I do not see anything
more of him for three months. And all the time he will be
walking miles and miles. Once he went right into Scotland, and
never once slept in a house. He took not even a handbag with
him or a clean shirt, but lived just like any old tramp.'</p></div>

<p>Mr. Baldrey is clearly in error here, or shall we say that Mrs. Borrow
humorously exaggerated? We have seen that Borrow's annual holiday was a
matter of careful arrangement, and his knapsack or satchel is frequently
referred to in his descriptions of his various tours. But the matter is
of little importance, and Mr. Baldrey's pictures of Borrow are
excellent, including that of his personal appearance:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As I recall him, he was a fine, powerfully built man of about
six feet high. He had a clean-shaven face with a fresh
complexion, almost approaching to the florid, and never a
wrinkle, even at sixty, except at the corners of his dark and
rather prominent eyes. He had a shock of silvery white hair. He
always wore a very badly brushed silk hat, a black frock coat
and trousers, the coat all buttoned down before; low shoes and
white socks, with a couple of inches of white showing between
the shoes and the trousers. He was a tireless walker, with
extraordinary powers of endurance, and was also very handy with
his fists, as in those days a gentleman required to be, more
than he does now.</p></div>

<p>Mr. John Pilgrim lived at Brunswick House, on the Newmarket Road,
Norwich, and here Borrow frequently visited him. Mr. Baldrey recalls one
particular visit:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">

CONTINENTAL JOURNEY OF 1844" title="" />
<span class="caption">A LETTER FROM BORROW TO HIS WIFE WRITTEN FROM ROME IN HIS
CONTINENTAL JOURNEY OF 1844</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have a curious recollection of his dining one night at
Brunswick House. John Pilgrim, who was a careful, abstemious
man, never took more than two glasses of port at dinner.
'John,' said Borrow, 'this is a good port. I prefer Burgundy if
you can get it good; but, lord, you cannot get it now.' It so
happened that Mr. Pilgrim had some fine old Clos-Vougeot in the
cellar. 'I think,' said he, 'I can give you a good drop of
Burgundy.' A bottle was sent for, and Borrow finished it, alone
and unaided. 'Well,' he remarked, 'I think this is a good
Burgundy. But I'm not quite certain. I should like to try a
little more.' Another bottle was called up, and the guest
finished it to the last drop. I am still,' he said, 'not quite
sure about it, but I shall know in the morning.' The next
morning Mr. Pilgrim and I were leaving for the office, when
Borrow came up the garden path waving his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> arms like a
windmill. 'Oh, John,' he said, 'that <i>was</i> Burgundy! When I
woke up this morning it was coursing through my veins like
fire.' And yet Borrow was not a man to drink to excess. I
cannot imagine him being the worse for liquor. He had wonderful
health and digestion. Neither a gourmand nor a gourmet, he
could take down anything, and be none the worse for it. I don't
think you could have made him drunk if you tried.</p></div>

<p>And here is a glimpse of Borrow after his wife's death, for which we are
grateful to Mr. Baldrey:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After the funeral of Mrs. Borrow he came to Norwich and took me
over to Oulton with him. He was silent all the way. When we got
to the little white wicket gate before the approach to the
house he took off his hat and began to beat his breast like an
Oriental. He cried aloud all the way up the path. He calmed
himself, however, by the time that Mr. Crabbe had opened the
door and asked us in. Crabbe brought in some wine, and we all
sat down to table. I sat opposite to Mrs. Crabbe; her husband
was on my left hand. Borrow sat at one end of the table, and
the chair at the opposite end was left vacant. We were talking
in a casual way when Borrow, pointing to the empty chair, said
with profound emotion, 'There! It was there that I first saw
her.' It was a curious coincidence that though there were four
of us we should have left that particular seat unoccupied at a
little table of about four feet square.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is a lengthy digression from the story of Henrietta Clarke, who
married William MacOubrey, an Irishman&mdash;and an Orangeman&mdash;from Belfast
in 1865. The pair lived first in Belfast and afterwards at 80 Charlotte
Street, Fitzroy Square. Before his marriage he had practised at 134
Sloane Street, London. MacOubrey, although there has been some doubt
cast upon the statement, was a Doctor of Medicine of Trinity College,
Dublin, and a Barrister-at-Law. Within his limitations he was an
accomplished man, and before me lie not only documentary evidence of his
M.D. and his legal status, but several printed pamphlets that bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> his
name.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> What is of more importance, the letters from and to his wife
that have through my hands and have been consigned to the flames prove
that husband and wife lived on most affectionate terms.</p>

<p>It is natural that Borrow's correspondence with his stepdaughter should
have been of a somewhat private character, and I therefore publish only
a selection from his letters to her, believing however that they modify
an existing tradition very considerably:</p>


<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;Have you heard from the gentleman whom you
said you would write to about the farm?<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Mr. C. came over
the other day and I mentioned the matter to him, but he told me
that he was on the eve of going to London on law business and
should be absent for some time. His son is in Cambridge. I am
afraid that it will be no easy matter to find a desirable
tenant and that none are likely to apply but a set of needy
speculators; indeed, there is a general dearth of money. How is
Dr. M.? God bless you!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I have received some of the rent and send a
cheque for eight pounds. Have the kindness to acknowledge the
receipt of same by return of post. As soon as you arrive in
London, let me know, and I will send a cheque for ten pounds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>

<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;As soon as Smith has paid his Michaelmas rent
I will settle your interest up to Midsummer. Twenty-one pounds
was, I think, then due to you, as you received five pounds on
the account of the present year. If, however, you are in want
of money let me know forthwith, and I will send you a small
cheque. The document which I mentioned has been witnessed by
Mrs. Church and her daughter. It is in one of the little tin
boxes on the lower shelf of the closet nearest to the window in
my bedroom. I was over at Mattishall some weeks ago. Things
there look very unsatisfactory. H. and his mother now owe me
&pound;20 or more. The other man a year's rent for a cottage and
garden, and two years' rent for the gardens of two cottages
unoccupied. I am just returned from Norwich where I have been
to speak to F. I have been again pestered by Pilgrim's
successor about the insurance of the property. He pretends to
have insured again. A more impudent thing was probably never
heard of. He is no agent of mine, and I will have no
communication with him. I have insured myself in the Union
Office, and have lately received my second policy. I have now
paid upwards of twelve pounds for policies. F. says that he
told him months ago that the demand he made would not be
allowed, that I insured myself and was my own agent, and that
as he shall see him in a few days he will tell him so again. Oh
what a source of trouble that wretched fellow Pilgrim has been
both to you and me.</p>

<p>I wish very much to come up to London. But I cannot leave the
country under present circumstances. There is not a person in
these parts in whom I can place the slightest confidence. I
most inform you that at our interview F. said not a word about
the matter in Chancery. God bless you. Kind remembrances to Dr.
M.</p></div>

<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I wish to know how you are. I shall shortly
send a cheque for thirteen pounds, which I believe will settle
the interest account up to Michaelmas. If you see anything
inaccurate pray inform me. I am at present tolerably well, but
of late have been very much troubled with respect to my people.
Since I saw you I have been three times over to Mattishall, but
with very little profit. The last time I was there I got the
key of the house from that fellow Hill, and let the place to
another person who I am now told is not much better. One
comfort is that he cannot be worse. But now there is a
difficulty. Hill refuses to yield up the land, and has put
padlocks on the gates. These I suppose can be removed as he is
not in possession of the key of the house. On this point,
however, I wish to be certain. As for the house, he and his
mother, who is in a kind of partnership with him, have
abandoned it for two years, the consequence being that the
windows are dashed out, and the place little better than a
ruin. During the four years he has occupied the land he has
been cropping it, and the crops have invariably been sold
before being reaped, and as soon as reaped carried off. During
the last two years there has not been a single live thing kept
on the premises, not so much as a hen. He now says that there
are some things in the house belonging to him. Anything,
however, which he has left is of course mine, though I don't
believe that what he has left is worth sixpence. I have told
the incoming tenant to deliver up nothing, and not permit him
to enter the house on any account. He owes me ten or twelve
pounds, arrears of rent, and at least fifteen for
dilapidations. I think the fellow ought to be threatened with
an action, but I know not whom to employ. I don't wish to apply
to F. Perhaps Dr. M.'s London friend might be spoken to. I
believe Hill's address is Alfred Hill, Mattishall, Norfolk, but
the place which he occupied of me is at Mattishall Burgh. I
shall be glad to hear from you as soon as is convenient. I have
anything but reason to be satisfied with the conduct of S. He
is cropping the ground most unmercifully, and is sending sacks
of game off the premises every week. Surely he must be mad, as
he knows I can turn him out next Michaelmas. God bless you.
Kind regards to Dr. M. Take care of this.</p></div>

<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I was glad to hear that you had obtained your
dividend. I was afraid that you would never get it. I shall be

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I send a cheque for &pound;15, which will settle the
interest account up to Michaelmas last. On receipt of this have
the kindness to send me a line. I have been to Norwich, and now
know all about your affair. I saw Mr. Durrant, who, it seems,
is the real head of the firm to which I go. He received me in
the kindest manner, and said he was very glad to see me. I
inquired about J.P.'s affairs. He appeared at first not
desirous to speak about them, but presently became very
communicative. I inquired who had put the matter into Chancery,
and he told me he himself, which I was very glad to hear. I
asked whether the mortgagees would get their money, and he
replied that he had no doubt they eventually would, as far as
principal was concerned. I spoke about interest, but on that
point he gave me slight hopes. He said that the matter, if not
hurried, would turn out tolerably satisfactory, but if it were,
very little would be obtained. It appears that the unhappy
creature who is gone had been dabbling in post obit bonds, at
present almost valueless, but likely to become available. He
was in great want of money shortly before he died. Now, dear,
pray keep up your spirits; I hope and trust we shall meet about
Christmas. Kind regards to Dr. M.</p></div>

<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I thought I would write to you as it seems a
long time since I heard from you. I have been on my expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
and have come back safe. I had a horrible time of it on the
sea&mdash;small dirty boat crowded with people and rough weather.
Poor Mr. Brightwell is I am sorry to say dead&mdash;died in January.
I saw Mr. J. and P. and had a good deal of conversation with
them which I will talk to you about when I see you. Mr. P. sent
an officer over to M. I went to Oulton, and as soon as I got
there I found one of the farm cottages nearly in ruins; the
gable had fallen down&mdash;more expense! but I said that some
willow trees must be cut down to cover it. The place upon the
whole looks very beautiful. C. full of complaints, though I
believe he has a fine time of it. He and T. are at daggers
drawn. I am sorry to tell you that poor Mr. Leathes is
dying&mdash;called, but could not see him, but he sent down a kind
message to me. The family, however, were rejoiced to see me and
wanted me to stay. The scoundrel of a shoemaker did not send
the shoes. I thought he would not. The shirt-collars were much
too small. I, however, managed to put on the shirts and am glad
of them. At Norwich I saw Lucy, who appears to be in good
spirits. Many people have suffered dreadfully there from the
failure of the Bank&mdash;her brother, amongst others, has been let
in. I shall have much to tell you when I see you. I am glad
that the Prussians are getting on so famously. The Pope it
seems has written a letter to the King of Prussia and is asking
favours of him. A low old fellow!!! Remember me kindly to Miss
H., and may God bless you! Bring this back.</p></div>

<p>Here I find a letter from Mrs. MacOubrey to her stepfather:</p>


<h3>To George Borrow, Esq.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Southgate House, Bury St. Edmunds</span>, <i>Novbr. 25th, 1873.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My beloved Friend</span>,&mdash;I sincerely trust that you are well, and
received my letter which I sent about ten days ago. Miss Harvey
is pretty well and very kind, and it really is a great pleasure
to be here during the dark foggy month of November, the most
disagreeable in London. I saw Miss Beevor the other day; she is
confined to the house with rheumatism and a strain; she was so
pleased to see me, and talked about the Images of Mildenhall.
They now set up for the great county gentry; give very grand
entertainments, dinners, etc., and go also to grand dinners, so
their time is fully taken up going and receiving; they never
scarce honour the little paltry town of Bury St. Edmunds.
Bloomfield, the old butler, is gone to service again; he could
not bear himself without horses, so he is gone to the Wigsons,
near Bury, where he will have plenty of hunters to look after;
he wished to live with Miss Harvey.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Borton died about a week ago; she did not live long
to enjoy the huge fortune her brother left. Bury seems very
much changing its inhabitants, but there are still some nice
people. I shall always like it while dear Miss Harvey lives;
she is so very kind to me. It is extremely cold, but we keep
tremendous fires, which combats it.</p>

<p>I do sincerely trust, dear, that you are well. I should like
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> have a line just to say how you are. I return to London the
6th of Decbr., not later, but you see Miss Harvey likes to keep
me as long as she can, and I am very happy with her, but at
that time I shall be sure to be at home. If you were going up
to London I would leave sooner. If you want any medicine or
anything, only let me know and you shall have it.</p>

<p>Accept my most affec. love, and believe me ever, your attached
daughter,</p></div>

as soon as you can conveniently come. Send me a line to say
when I may expect you. I have no engagements. Before you come
call at No. 36 to inquire whether anything has been sent there.
Leverton had better be employed to make a couple of boxes or
cases for the books in the sacks. The sacks can be put on the
top in the inside. There is an old coat in one of the sacks in
the pocket of which are papers. Let it be put in with its
contents just as it is. I wish to have the long white chest and
the two deal boxes also brought down. Buy me a thick
under-waistcoat like that I am now wearing, and a lighter one

worsted. Kind regards to Dr. M. God bless you!</p>

refused to act, as the following letter to Mrs. MacOubrey

<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dearest Henrietta</span>,&mdash;I was just preparing to write to you
when yours arrived together with Mrs. Reeve's despatch. You
know how earnestly I desire your welfare&mdash;but <i>because</i> I do so
I earnestly advise you immediately to exercise the right you
have of appointing another trustee in my place. I am sure it
will be best for you. You ought to have a trustee at least
<i>not</i> older than yourself, and one who has health and strength
for discharging the office. I <i>know</i> what are the duties of a
trustee. There's <i>always</i> a considerable responsibility
involved in the discharge of the duties of a trustee&mdash;and it
may easily occur that great responsibility may be thrown on
them, and it may become an anxious business fit only for those
who have youth and health and strength of mind, and are likely
to live.</p>

<p>My dear friend, you do not like to realise the old age of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
dear friends, but you must consider that I am quite past the
age for such an office, and my invalid state often prevents my
attending to my own small affairs. I have no relation or
confidential friend who can act for me. My executors were Miss
Venn and John Venn. Miss Venn departed last February to a
better land. John is in such health with heart disease that he
cannot move far from his home&mdash;he writes as one <i>ready</i> and
desiring to depart. I do not expect to see <i>him</i> again. So you
see, my dearest friend, I am not able to undertake this
trusteeship, and I think the sooner you consult Mrs. Reeve as
to the appointment of another trustee&mdash;the better it will
be&mdash;and the more <i>permanent</i>. Had I known it was Mr. Borrow's
intention to put down my name I should have prevented it, and
he would have seen that an aged and invalid lady was not the
person to carry out his wishes&mdash;for I am quite unable.</p>

<p>I pray that a fit person may be induced to undertake the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
business, and that it may please God so to order all for your
good. It is indeed the greatest mercy that your dear husband is
well enough to afford you such help and such comfort. Pray hire
a proper servant who will obey orders.&mdash;In haste, ever yrs.
affectionately,</p></div>

<p>Another letter that has some bearing upon Borrow's last days is worth

<h3>To Mrs. MacOubrey</h3>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Yarmouth</span>, <i>August 19, 1881.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. MacOubrey</span>,&mdash;I was very sorry indeed to hear of Mr.
Borrow's death. I thought he looked older the last time I saw
him, but with his vigorous constitution I have not thought the
end so near. You and Mr. MacOubrey have the comfort of knowing
that you have attended affectionately to his declining years,
which would otherwise have been very lonely. I have been abroad
for a short time, and this has prevented me from replying to
your kind letter before. Pray receive the assurance of my
sympathy, and with my kind remembrances to Mr. MacOubrey,
believe me, yours very truly,</p></div>

</p>

<p>Three years later Dr. MacOubrey died in his eighty-fourth year, and was
interred at Oulton. Mrs. MacOubrey lived for a time at Oulton and then
removed to Yarmouth. A letter that she wrote to a friend soon after the
death of her husband is perhaps some index to her character:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Oulton Cottage, Oulton, Nr. Lowestoft</span>, <i>Sept. 3rd, 1884.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg to thank you for your kind thought of me.
On Sunday night the 24th Augst., it pleased God to take from me
my excellent and beloved husband&mdash;his age was nearly 84. He
sunk simply from age and weakness. I was his nurse by night and
by day, administering constant nourishment, but he became
weaker and weaker, till at last 'The silver cord was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> loosed.'
My dear father died about this time three years since, which
makes the blow more stunning. I feel very lonely now in my
secluded residence on the banks of the Broad&mdash;the music of the
wild birds adds not to my pleasure now. Trusting that yourself
and Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; may long be spared.&mdash;Believe me to remain, yours
very truly,</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><span class="smcap">Henrietta MacOubrey.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>The cottage at Oulton was soon afterwards pulled down, but the
summer-house where Borrow wrote a portion of his <i>Bible in Spain</i> and
his other works remained for some years. That ultimately an entirely new
structure took its place may be seen by comparing the roof in Mrs.
MacOubrey's drawing with the illustration of the structure as it is
to-day. Mrs. MacOubrey died in 1903 at Yarmouth, and the following
inscription may be found on her tomb in Oulton Churchyard:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sacred to the memory of Henrietta Mary, widow of William
MacOubrey, only daughter of Lieut. Henry Clarke, R.N., and Mary
Skepper, his wife, and stepdaughter of George Henry Borrow,
Esq., the celebrated author of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, <i>The
Gypsies of Spain</i>, <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>The Romany Rye</i>, <i>Wild Wales</i>,
and other works and translations. Henrietta Mary MacOubrey was
born at Oulton Hall in this Parish, May 17th, 1818, and died
23rd December 1903. 'And He shall give His angels charge over
thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.'&mdash;Psalm xci. 11.</p></div>

<p>The following extract from her will is of interest as indicating the

MacOubrey's later years, whose opinion is of more value than that of
village gossips, speak of her in terms of sincere affection:</p>

endorsement from that pleasant writer Mr. W. A. Dutt, who has long lived
near Lowestoft. It is conveyed in such a communication as the following
from a correspondent: 'After Borrow's death Mr. Reeve, Curator of
Norwich Castle Museum, visited the Oulton house with the Rev. J. Gunn
(died 28th May 1890), having some idea of buying Borrow's books for the
Colman collection. Mrs. MacOubrey wanted &pound;1000 for them, but Mr. Reeve
did not think them worth more than &pound;200. They were, however, bought by
Webber of Ipswich, who soon afterwards entered into the employment of
Jarrold of Norwich. Mr. Reeve described the scene as one of rank
dilapidation and decay&mdash;evidences of extreme untidiness and neglect
everywhere.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_255_255" id="Footnote_255_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_255_255"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> Mr. Herbert Jenkins has drawn a quite wrong
conclusion&mdash;although natural under the circumstances&mdash;from a letter he
had seen in which Borrow asked his wife for money. Mrs. Borrow kept the
banking account. Moreover, it is not generally known that Borrow
completed the possession of his wife's estate, including Oulton Hall
farm and some cottage property, with the money that came to him from
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>.</p></div>

Press</i>, July 31, 1913.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_257_257" id="Footnote_257_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> Mr. Baldrey also gives us reminiscences of Borrow's
prowess as a swimmer:
</p><p>
'It was one of the signs of his perfect health and vigour that he was a
fine swimmer. On one occasion George Jay and John Pilgrim were out for a
sail in Jay's old yacht, the <i>Widgeon</i>. Becalmed, they were drifting
somewhere down by Reedham, when suddenly Borrow said, "George, how deep
is it here?" "About twenty-two feet, sir," said George Jay. The partners
always called him "sir." "George," said Borrow, "I am going to the
bottom." Straightway he stripped, dived, and presently came up with a
handful of mud and weeds. "There, George," he said, "I've been to the
bottom," Some time in 1872 or 1873, for Borrow was then sixty-nine, my
mother and I were walking on the beach at Lowestoft, when just round the
Ness Light we met Borrow coming: towards us from the Corton side. He got
hold of my shoulder, and, pointing to the big black buoy beyond the
Ness, he said, "There! Do you see that? I have just been out there. I
have not been back many minutes." At the age of nearly seventy he had
been round the Ness Buoy and home again&mdash;a wonderful performance if, in
addition to his age, you remember the dangerous set of the currents
thereabouts.'
</p><p>
There is also a story, which comes to me from another quarter, of Borrow
skating upon the ice of Oulton Broad a few months before his death, and
remarking that he had not skated since he was in Russia. The following
passage from Mr. Baldrey's narrative is interesting as showing that
Borrow did not in later life quite lose sight of his birthplace:
</p><p>
'Apparently I interested him in some way, for twice while I was at
school at East Dereham he came over specially to take me out for the
afternoon. He had ascertained from my mother which were the school
half-holidays, and purposely chose those days so that I might be free.
We would start off at half-past twelve and return at bedtime. Where we
went I could not tell you for certain, but I know that once we went
through Scarning and once through Mattishall. What we talked about of
course I cannot recall, for I was then a boy between 13 and 15 years of
age, and I had no sort of inkling that my companion was even then a
celebrity and destined to be a still greater one in the future. But I do
remember that sometimes I could not get a word out of him for an hour or
more, and that then suddenly he would break out with all sorts of
questions. "I wonder if you can see what I can," he once remarked. "Do
you see that the gypsies have been here?" "No," I replied. "And you are
not likely to," said he. And then he would tell me no more. He was
rather prone to arouse one's curiosity and refuse to pursue the subject.
I do not mean that he was morose. Far from it. He was always very kind
to me. After I had left school and returned to Norwich he frequently
called for me and took me out with him. Once or twice I went with him to
Lowestoft.'</p></div>

of sympathy, and there are passages in it that may well be taken to
heart when it is considered that Miss Harvey was the most intimate
friend of Borrow and his stepdaughter:
</p><p>
'<span class="smcap">Bury</span>, <i>August 1st, 1881.</i>
</p><p>
'<span class="smcap">Dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;Though I cannot be with you in your trouble I am
continually thinking of you, and praying that all needful help and
comfort may be sent to you <i>as</i> you need and <i>how</i> you need it. I have
no means of hearing any particulars, and am most anxious to know how you
do, and how you have got through the last painful week. Whenever you
feel able write me a few words, I await them with much anxiety. When you
are able to realise the <i>reality</i> of his eternal gain&mdash;you will feel
that all is well. A <i>great</i> spirit, a great and noble spirit, has passed
from the earth, his earthly tabernacle is taken down to be raised
again&mdash;glorious and immortal, a fitting abode for a spirit of the just
<i>made perfect</i>. How wonderful are those words, "made perfect." We are
even now part of that grand assembly where they dwell. "We are come to
the general assembly and church of the first born which are written in
heaven. To God the judge of all, to Jesus the Mediator, to an
innumerable company of angels, etc., to the <i>spirits of the just made
perfect</i>." Let us realise our communion with them even now, and <i>soon</i>
to meet them on the Resurrection Morn&mdash;when they who sleep in Jesus will
God <i>bring</i> with Him ... and so we shall be ever with the Lord.

</div></div>

<p>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, their <i>works</i> do follow
them. Your beloved father's work in Spain will follow <i>him</i>. His efforts
to spread the word of God in that benighted land, ever has and ever will
bring forth blessed fruits. Dearest Henrietta, be comforted, you have
been a most devoted daughter to him, and latterly his greatest earthly
comfort; your dear husband also; and together you have tended him to the
last. He now rests in peace. All the sufferings of mind and body are
over for ever. You will have much earthly business on your hands. I pray
that you may be directed in all things by true wisdom. The time is
short, we must set our houses in order, that we may not be unnecessarily
burdened with earthly cares. Having food and raiment, let us be
therewith content.

'Let us be without carefulness, and so quietly and piously spend the

finding in <i>Him</i> all our comfort and all our joy, and when our own time

of the just is as the shining light which shineth more and more unto the

<h3>THE AFTERMATH</h3>

<p>'We are all Borrovians now.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustine Birrell</span>.</p>


<p>It is a curious fact that of only two men of distinction in English
letters in these later years can it be said that they lived to a good
old age and yet failed of recognition for work that is imperishable.
Many poets have died young&mdash;Shelley and Keats for example&mdash;to whom this
public recognition was refused in their lifetime. But given the
happiness of reaching middle age, this recognition has never failed. It
came, for example, to Wordsworth and Coleridge long after their best
work was done. It came with more promptness to all the great Victorian
novelists. This recognition did not come in their lifetime to two
Suffolk friends, Edward FitzGerald with <i>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i> and George Borrow
with <i>Lavengro</i>. In the case of FitzGerald there was probably no
consciousness that he had produced a great poem. In any case his sunny
Irish temperament could easily have surmounted disappointment if he had
expected anything from the world in the way of literary fame. Borrow was
quite differently made. He was as intense an egoist as Rousseau, whose
work he had probably never read, and would not have appreciated if he
had read. He longed for the recognition of the multitude through his
books, and thoroughly enjoyed it when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> was given to him for a
moment&mdash;for his <i>Bible in Spain</i>. Such appreciation as he received in
his lifetime was given to him for that book and for no other. There were
here and there enthusiasts for his <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>Romany Rye</i>. Dr.
Jessopp has told us that he was one. But it was not until long after his
death that the word 'Borrovian'<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> came into the language. Not a
single great author among his contemporaries praised him for his
<i>Lavengro</i>, the book for which we most esteem him to-day. His name is
not mentioned by Carlyle or Tennyson or Ruskin in all their voluminous
works. Among the novelists also he is of no account. Dickens and
Thackeray and George Eliot knew him not. Charlotte Bront&euml; does indeed
write of him with enthusiasm,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> but she is alone among the great
Victorian authors in this particular. Borrow's <i>Lavengro</i> received no
commendation from contemporary writers of the first rank. He died in his
seventy-eighth year an obscure recluse whose works were all but
forgotten. Since that year, 1881, his fame has been continually growing.
His greatest work, <i>Lavengro</i>, has been reprinted with introductions by
many able critics;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> notable essayists have proclaimed his worth. Of
these Mr. Watts-Dunton and Mr. Augustine Birrell have been the most
assiduous. The efforts of the former have already been noted. Mr.
Birrell has expressed his devotion in more than one essay.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
Referring to a casual reference by Robert Louis Stevenson to <i>The Bible
in Spain</i>,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> in which R. L. S. speaks well of that book, Mr. Birrell,
not without irony, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is interesting to know this, interesting, that is, to the
great Clan Stevenson, who owe suit and service to their liege
lord; but so far as Borrow is concerned, it does not matter, to
speak frankly, two straws. The author of <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>The
Romany Rye</i>, <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, and <i>Wild Wales</i> is one of
those kings of literature who never need to number their tribe.
His personality will always secure him an attendant company,
who, when he pipes, must dance.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>This is to sum up the situation to perfection. You cannot force people
to become readers of Borrow by argument, by criticism, or by the force
of authority. You reach the stage of admiration and even love by effects
which rise remote from all questions of style or taste. To say, as does
a recent critic, that 'there is something in Borrow after all; not so
much as most people suppose, but still a great deal,'<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> is to miss
the compelling power of his best books as they strike those with whom
they are among the finest things in literature.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In attempting to
interest new readers in the man&mdash;and this book is not for the sect
called Borrovians, to whom I recommend the earlier biographies, but for
a wider public which knows not Borrow&mdash;I hope I shall succeed in sending
many to those incomparable works, which have given me so many pleasant
hours.</p>

Groome, and Thomas Seccombe. Lionel Johnson's essay on Borrow is the
more valuable in its enthusiasm in that it was written by a Roman
Catholic. Writing in the <i>Outlook</i> (April 1, 1899) he said:
</p><p>
'What the four books mean and are to their lovers is upon this sort.
Written by a man of intense personality, irresistible in his hold upon
your attention, they take you far afield from weary cares and business
into the enamouring airs of the open world, and into days when the
countryside was uncontaminated by the vulgar conventions which form the
worst side of "civilised" life in cities. They give you the sense of
emancipation, of manumission into the liberty of the winding road and
fragrant forest, into the freshness of an ancient country-life, into a
<i>milieu</i> where men are not copies of each other. And you fall in with
strange scenes of adventure, great or small, of which a strange man is
the centre as he is the scribe; and from a description of a lonely glen
you are plunged into a dissertation upon difficult old tongues, and from
dejection into laughter, and from gypsydom into journalism, and
everything is equally delightful, and nothing that the strange man shows
you can come amiss. And you will hardly make up your mind whether he is
most Don Quixote, or Rousseau, or Luther, or Defoe; but you will always
love these books by a brave man who travelled in far lands, travelled
far in his own land, travelled the way of life for close upon eighty
years, and died in perfect solitude. And this will be the least you can
say, though he would not have you say it&mdash;<i>Requiescat in pace Viator</i>.'</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
